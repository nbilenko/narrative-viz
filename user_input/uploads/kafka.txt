Kafka on the Shore
by Haruki Murakami
The Boy Named Crow
"So you're all set for money, then?" the boy named Crow asks in his typical sluggish
voice. The kind of voice like when you've just woken up and your mouth still feels
heavy and dull. But he's just pretending. He's totally awake. As always.
I nod.
"How much?"
I review the numbers in my head. "Close to thirty-five hundred in cash, plus some
money I can get from an ATM. I know it's not a lot, but it should be enough. For the
time being."
"Not bad," the boy named Crow says. "For the time being."
I give him another nod.
"I'm guessing this isn't Christmas money from Santa Claus."
"Yeah, you're right," I reply.
Crow smirks and looks around. "I imagine you've started by rifling drawers, am I
right?"
I don't say anything. He knows whose money we're talking about, so there's no
need for any long-winded interrogations. He's just giving me a hard time.
"No matter," Crow says. "You really need this money and you're going to get it--
beg, borrow, or steal. It's your father's money, so who cares, right? Get your hands on
that much and you should be able to make it. For the time being. But what's the plan
after it's all gone? Money isn't like mushrooms in a forest--it doesn't just pop up on its
own, you know. You'll need to eat, a place to sleep. One day you're going to run out."
"I'll think about that when the time comes," I say.
"When the time comes," Crow repeats, as if weighing these words in his hand.
I nod.
"Like by getting a job or something?"
"Maybe," I say.
Crow shakes his head. "You know, you've got a lot to learn about the world.
Listen--what kind of job could a fifteen-year-old kid get in some far-off place he's never
been to before? You haven't even finished junior high. Who do you think's going to hire
you?"
I blush a little. It doesn't take much to make me blush.
"Forget it," he says. "You're just getting started and I shouldn't lay all this
depressing stuff on you. You've already decided what you're going to do, and all that's
left is to set the wheels in motion. I mean, it's your life. Basically you gotta go with what
you think is right."
That's right. When all is said and done, it is my life.
"I'll tell you one thing, though. You're going to have to get a lot tougher if you
want to make it."
"I'm trying my best," I say.
"I'm sure you are," Crow says. "These last few years you've gotten a whole lot
stronger. I've got to hand it to you."
I nod again.
"But let's face it--you're only fifteen," Crow goes on. "Your life's just begun and
there's a ton of things out in the world you've never laid eyes on. Things you never could
imagine."
As always, we're sitting beside each other on the old sofa in my father's study.
Crow loves the study and all the little objects scattered around there. Now he's toying
with a bee-shaped glass paperweight. If my father was at home, you can bet Crow would
never go anywhere near it.
"But I have to get out of here," I tell him. "No two ways around it."
"Yeah, I guess you're right." He places the paperweight back on the table and
links his hands behind his head. "Not that running away's going to solve everything. I
don't want to rain on your parade or anything, but I wouldn't count on escaping this
place if I were you. No matter how far you run. Distance might not solve anything."
The boy named Crow lets out a sigh, then rests a fingertip on each of his closed
eyelids and speaks to me from the darkness within.
"How about we play our game?" he says.
"All right," I say. I close my eyes and quietly take a deep breath.
"Okay, picture a terrible sandstorm," he says. "Get everything else out of your
head."
I do what he says, get everything else out of my head. I forget who I am, even.
I'm a total blank. Then things start to surface. Things that--as we sit here on the old
leather sofa in my father's study--both of us can see.
"Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions," Crow
says.
Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You
change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts.
Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn.
Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has
nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is
give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so
the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon,
no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like
pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.
And that's exactly what I do. I imagine a white funnel stretching up vertically like
a thick rope. My eyes are closed tight, hands cupped over my ears, so those fine grains
of sand can't blow inside me. The sandstorm draws steadily closer. I can feel the air
pressing on my skin. It really is going to swallow me up.
The boy called Crow softly rests a hand on my shoulder, and with that the storm
vanishes.
"From now on--no matter what--you've got to be the world's toughest fifteenyear-
old. That's the only way you're going to survive. And in order to do that, you've got
to figure out what it means to be tough. You following me?"
I keep my eyes closed and don't reply. I just want to sink off into sleep like this,
his hand on my shoulder. I hear the faint flutter of wings.
"You're going to be the world's toughest fifteen-year-old," Crow whispers as I try
to fall asleep. Like he was carving the words in a deep blue tattoo on my heart.
And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic
storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it
will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will
bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the
blood of others.
And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how
you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really
over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same
person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.
On my fifteenth birthday I'll run away from home, journey to a far-off town, and
live in a corner of a small library. It'd take a week to go into the whole thing, all the
details. So I'll just give the main point. On my fifteenth birthday I'll run away from
home, journey to a far-off town, and live in a corner of a small library.
It sounds a little like a fairy tale. But it's no fairy tale, believe me. No matter what
sort of spin you put on it.
Chapter 1
Cash isn't the only thing I take from my father's study when I leave home. I take a small,
old gold lighter--I like the design and feel of it--and a folding knife with a really sharp
blade. Made to skin deer, it has a five-inch blade and a nice heft. Probably something he
bought on one of his trips abroad. I also take a sturdy, bright pocket flashlight out of a
drawer. Plus sky blue Revo sunglasses to disguise my age.
I think about taking my father's favorite Sea-Dweller Oyster Rolex. It's a beautiful
watch, but something flashy will only attract attention. My cheap plastic Casio watch
with an alarm and stopwatch will do just fine, and might actually be more useful.
Reluctantly, I return the Rolex to its drawer.
From the back of another drawer I take out a photo of me and my older sister
when we were little, the two of us on a beach somewhere with grins plastered across our
faces. My sister's looking off to the side so half her face is in shadow and her smile is
neatly cut in half. It's like one of those Greek tragedy masks in a textbook that's half one
idea and half the opposite. Light and dark. Hope and despair. Laughter and sadness.
Trust and loneliness. For my part I'm staring straight ahead, undaunted, at the camera.
Nobody else is there at the beach. My sister and I have on swimsuits--hers a red floralprint
one-piece, mine some baggy old blue trunks. I'm holding a plastic stick in my hand.
White foam is washing over our feet.
Who took this, and where and when, I have no clue. And how could I have
looked so happy? And why did my father keep just that one photo? The whole thing is a
total mystery. I must have been three, my sister nine. Did we ever really get along that
well? I have no memory of ever going to the beach with my family. No memory of
going anywhere with them. No matter, though--there is no way I'm going to leave that
photo with my father, so I put it in my wallet. I don't have any photos of my mother. My
father threw them all away.
After giving it some thought I decide to take the cell phone with me. Once he
finds out I've taken it, my father will probably get the phone company to cut off service.
Still, I toss it into my backpack, along with the adapter. Doesn't add much weight, so
why not. When it doesn't work anymore I'll just chuck it.
Just the bare necessities, that's all I need. Choosing which clothes to take is the
hardest thing. I'll need a couple sweaters and pairs of underwear. But what about shirts
and trousers? Gloves, mufflers, shorts, a coat? There's no end to it. One thing I do know,
though. I don't want to wander around some strange place with a huge backpack that
screams out, Hey, everybody, check out the runaway! Do that and someone is sure to sit
up and take notice. Next thing you know the police will haul me in and I'll be sent
straight home. If I don't wind up in some gang first.
Any place cold is definitely out, I decide. Easy enough, just choose the opposite--
a warm place. Then I can leave the coat and gloves behind, and get by with half the
clothes. I pick out wash-and-wear-type things, the lightest ones I have, fold them neatly,
and stuff them in my backpack. I also pack a three-season sleeping bag, the kind that
rolls up nice and tight, toilet stuff, a rain poncho, notebook and pen, a Walkman and ten
discs--got to have my music--along with a spare rechargeable battery. That's about it. No
need for any cooking gear, which is too heavy and takes up too much room, since I can
buy food at the local convenience store.
It takes a while but I'm able to subtract a lot of things from my list. I add things,
cross them off, then add a whole other bunch and cross them off, too.
My fifteenth birthday is the ideal time to run away from home. Any earlier and
it'd be too soon. Any later and I would have missed my chance.
During my first two years in junior high, I'd worked out, training myself for this
day. I started practicing judo in the first couple years of grade school, and still went
sometimes in junior high. But I didn't join any school teams. Whenever I had the time
I'd jog around the school grounds, swim, or go to the local gym. The young trainers
there gave me free lessons, showing me the best kind of stretching exercises and how to
use the fitness machines to bulk up. They taught me which muscles you use every day
and which ones can only be built up with machines, even the correct way to do a bench
press. I'm pretty tall to begin with, and with all this exercise I've developed pretty broad
shoulders and pecs. Most strangers would take me for seventeen. If I ran away looking
my actual age, you can imagine all the problems that would cause.
Other than the trainers at the gym and the housekeeper who comes to our house
every other day--and of course the bare minimum required to get by at school--I barely
talk to anyone. For a long time my father and I have avoided seeing each other. We live
under the same roof, but our schedules are totally different. He spends most of his time
in his studio, far away, and I do my best to avoid him.
The school I'm going to is a private junior high for kids who are upper-class, or at
least rich. It's the kind of school where, unless you really blow it, you're automatically
promoted to the high school on the same campus. All the students dress neatly, have
nice straight teeth, and are boring as hell. Naturally I have zero friends. I've built a wall
around me, never letting anybody inside and trying not to venture outside myself. Who
could like somebody like that? They all keep an eye on me, from a distance. They might
hate me, or even be afraid of me, but I'm just glad they didn't bother me. Because I had
tons of things to take care of, including spending a lot of my free time devouring books
in the school library.
I always paid close attention to what was said in class, though. Just like the boy
named Crow suggested.
The facts and techniques or whatever they teach you in class isn't going to be very
useful in the real world, that's for sure. Let's face it, teachers are basically a bunch of
morons. But you've got to remember this: you're running away from home. You
probably won't have any chance to go to school anymore, so like it or not you'd better
absorb whatever you can while you've got the chance. Become like a sheet of blotting
paper and soak it all in. Later on you can figure out what to keep and what to unload.
I did what he said, like I almost always do. My brain like a sponge, I focused on
every word said in class and let it all sink in, figured out what it meant, and committed
everything to memory. Thanks to this, I barely had to study outside of class, but always
came out near the top on exams.
My muscles were getting hard as steel, even as I grew more withdrawn and quiet.
I tried hard to keep my emotions from showing so that no one--classmates and teachers
alike--had a clue what I was thinking. Soon I'd be launched into the rough adult world,
and I knew I'd have to be tougher than anybody if I wanted to survive.
My eyes in the mirror are cold as a lizard's, my expression fixed and unreadable. I
can't remember the last time I laughed or even showed a hint of a smile to other people.
Even to myself.
I'm not trying to imply I can keep up this silent, isolated facade all the time.
Sometimes the wall I've erected around me comes crumbling down. It doesn't happen
very often, but sometimes, before I even realize what's going on, there I am--naked and
defenseless and totally confused. At times like that I always feel an omen calling out to
me, like a dark, omnipresent pool of water.
A dark, omnipresent pool of water.
It was probably always there, hidden away somewhere. But when the time comes
it silently rushes out, chilling every cell in your body. You drown in that cruel flood,
gasping for breath. You cling to a vent near the ceiling, struggling, but the air you
manage to breathe is dry and burns your throat. Water and thirst, cold and heat--these
supposedly opposite elements combine to assault you.
The world is a huge space, but the space that will take you in--and it doesn't have
to be very big--is nowhere to be found. You seek a voice, but what do you get? Silence.
You look for silence, but guess what? All you hear over and over and over is the voice
of this omen. And sometimes this prophetic voice pushes a secret switch hidden deep
inside your brain.
Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, spilling over its banks.
All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone, inundated and carried away by that
rush of water. And still the rain beats down on the surface of the river. Every time you
see a flood like that on the news you tell yourself: That's it. That's my heart.
Before running away from home I wash my hands and face, trim my nails, swab
out my ears, and brush my teeth. I take my time, making sure my whole body's well
scrubbed. Being really clean is sometimes the most important thing there is. I gaze
carefully at my face in the mirror. Genes I'd gotten from my father and mother--not that
I have any recollection of what she looked like--created this face. I can do my best to not
let any emotions show, keep my eyes from revealing anything, bulk up my muscles, but
there's not much I can do about my looks. I'm stuck with my father's long, thick
eyebrows and the deep lines between them. I could probably kill him if I wanted to--I'm
sure strong enough--and I can erase my mother from my memory. But there's no way to
erase the DNA they passed down to me. If I wanted to drive that away I'd have to get rid
of me.
There's an omen contained in that. A mechanism buried inside of me.
A mechanism buried inside of you.
I switch off the light and leave the bathroom. A heavy, damp stillness lies over
the house. The whispers of people who don't exist, the breath of the dead. I look around,
standing stock-still, and take a deep breath. The clock shows three p. m., the two hands
cold and distant. They're pretending to be noncommittal, but I know they're not on my
side. It's nearly time for me to say good-bye. I pick up my backpack and slip it over my
shoulders. I've carried it any number of times, but now it feels so much heavier.
Shikoku, I decide. That's where I'll go. There's no particular reason it has to be
Shikoku, only that studying the map I got the feeling that's where I should head. The
more I look at the map--actually every time I study it--the more I feel Shikoku tugging
at me. It's far south of Tokyo, separated from the mainland by water, with a warm
climate. I've never been there, have no friends or relatives there, so if somebody started
looking for me--which I kind of doubt--Shikoku would be the last place they'd think of.
I pick up the ticket I'd reserved at the counter and climb aboard the night bus.
This is the cheapest way to get to Takamatsu--just a shade over ninety bucks. Nobody
pays me any attention, asks how old I am, or gives me a second look. The bus driver
mechanically checks my ticket.
Only a third of the seats are taken. Most passengers are traveling alone, like me,
and the bus is strangely silent. It's a long trip to Takamatsu, ten hours according to the
schedule, and we'll be arriving early in the morning. But I don't mind. I've got plenty of
time. The bus pulls out of the station at eight, and I push my seat back. No sooner do I
settle down than my consciousness, like a battery that's lost its charge, starts to fade
away, and I fall asleep.
Sometime in the middle of the night a hard rain begins to fall. I wake up every
once in a while, part the chintzy curtain at the window, and gaze out at the highway
rushing by. Raindrops beat against the glass, blurring streetlights alongside the road that
stretch off into the distance at identical intervals like they were set down to measure the
earth. A new light rushes up close and in an instant fades off behind us. I check my
watch and see it's past midnight. Automatically shoved to the front, my fifteenth
birthday makes its appearance.
"Hey, happy birthday," the boy named Crow says.
"Thanks," I reply.
The omen is still with me, though, like a shadow. I check to make sure the wall
around me is still in place. Then I close the curtain and fall back asleep.

U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE SECTION (MIS) REPORT Dated: May 12, 1946
Title: Report on the Rice Bowl Hill Incident, 1944 Document Number: PTYX-722-
8936745-42213-WWN The following is a taped interview with Setsuko Okamochi (26),
teacher in charge of the fourth-grade B class at the public school in [deleted] Town,
[deleted] County. Materials related to the interview can be accessed using application
number PTYX-722-SQ-118.
Impressions of the interviewer, Lt. Robert O'Connor: Setsuko Okamochi is an
attractive, petite woman. Intelligent and responsible, she responded to the questions
accurately and honestly. She still seems slightly in shock, though, from the incident. As
she searched her memory she grew very tense at times, and whenever this happened she
had a tendency to speak more slowly.
I think it must have been just after ten in the morning when I saw a silver light far
up in the sky. A brilliant flash of silver. That's right, it was definitely light reflecting off
something metal. That light moved very slowly in the sky from east to west. We all
thought it had to be a B-29. It was directly above us, so to see it we had to look straight
up. It was a clear blue sky, and the light was so bright all we could see was that silver,
duralumin-like object.
But we couldn't make out the shape, since it was too far up. I assumed that they
couldn't see us either, so we weren't afraid of being attacked or having bombs suddenly
rain down on us. Dropping bombs in the mountains here would be pretty pointless
anyway. I figured the plane was on its way to bomb some large city somewhere, or
maybe on its way back from a raid. So we kept on walking. All I thought was how that
light had a strange beauty to it.
--According to military records no U.S. bombers or any other kind of aircraft
were flying over that region at the time, that is, around ten a.m. on November 7, 1944.
But I saw it clearly, and so did the sixteen children in my class. All of us thought
it had to be a B-29. We'd all seen many formations of B-29s, and those are the only kind
of planes that could possibly fly that high. There was a small airbase in our prefecture,
and I'd occasionally seen Japanese planes flying, but they were all small and could never
fly as high as what I saw. Besides, the way duralumin reflects light is different from
other types of metal, and the only planes made out of that are B-29s. I did think it was a
little strange, though, that it was a solo plane flying all by itself, not part of a formation.
--Were you born in this region?
No, I was born in Hiroshima. I got married in 1941, and that's when I came here.
My husband was a music teacher in a junior high school in this prefecture. He was
called up in 1943 and died fighting in Luzon in June of 1945. From what I heard later,
he was guarding an ammunition dump just outside Manila when it was hit by American
shells and blew up, killing him. We have no children.
--Speaking of children, how many were you in charge of on that outing?
Sixteen all together, boys and girls. Two were out sick, but other than that it was
the entire class. Eight boys and eight girls. Five of them were children who'd been
evacuated from Tokyo.
We set out from the school at nine in the morning. It was a typical school outing,
so everyone carried canteens and lunches with them. We had nothing in particular we
were planning to study; we were just going up into the hills to gather mushrooms and
edible wild plants. The area around where we lived was farmland, so we weren't that
badly off in terms of food--which isn't to say we had plenty to eat. There was a strict
rationing system in place and most of us were hungry all the time.
So the children were encouraged to hunt for food wherever they could find it. The
country was at war, after all, and food took priority over studying. Everyone went on
this kind of school outing--outdoor study sessions, as they were called. Since our school
was surrounded by hills and woods, there were a lot of nice spots we used to go to. I
think we were blessed in that sense. People in cities were all starving. Supply routes
from Taiwan and the continent had been cut off by this time and urban areas were
suffering terribly from a lack of food and fuel.
--You mentioned that five of your pupils had been evacuated from Tokyo. Did
they get along well with the local children?
In my class at least they did. The environments the two groups grew up in, of
course, were completely different--one way out in the country, the other in the heart of
Tokyo. They spoke differently, even dressed differently. Most of the local kids were
from poor farming families, while the majority of the Tokyo children had fathers who
worked for companies or in the civil service. So I couldn't say they really understood
each other.
Especially in the beginning you could sense some tension between the two groups.
I'm not saying they bullied each other or got into fights, because they didn't. What I
mean is one group didn't seem to understand what the other group was thinking. So they
tended to keep to themselves, the local kids with other local kids, the Tokyo children in
their own little group. This was only the first two months, though. After that they got
along well. You know how it is. When kids start playing together and get completely
absorbed by whatever they're doing, they don't care about things like that anymore.
--I'd like you to describe, in as much detail as you can, the spot where you took
your class that day.
It was a hill we often went to on outings. It was a round hill shaped like an
upside-down bowl. We usually called it "Owan yama." [Note: "Rice Bowl Hill."] It was
a short walk to the west of the school and wasn't steep at all, so anybody could climb it.
At the children's pace it took somewhere around two hours to get to the top. Along the
way they'd search the woods for mushrooms and we'd have a simple lunch. The children,
naturally, enjoyed going on these outdoor sessions much more than staying in our
classroom studying.
The glittering airplane we saw way up in the sky reminded us for a moment of the
war, but just for a short time, and we were all in a good mood. There wasn't a cloud in
the sky, no wind, and everything was quiet around us--all we could hear were birds
chirping in the woods. The war seemed like something in a faraway land that had
nothing to do with us. We sang songs as we hiked up the hill, sometimes imitating the
birds we heard. Except for the fact that the war was still going on, it was a perfect
morning.
--It was soon after you observed the airplane-like object that you went into the
woods, correct?
That's correct. I'd say it was less than five minutes later that we went into the
woods. We left the main trail up the hill and went along a trampled-down path that went
up the slope of the woods. It was pretty steep. After we'd hiked for about ten minutes we
came to a clearing, a broad area as flat as a tabletop. Once we'd entered the woods it was
completely still, and with the sun blocked out it was chilly, but when we stepped into
that clearing it was like we were in a miniature town square, with the sky bright above
us. My class often stopped by this spot whenever we climbed Owan yama. The place
had a calming effect, and somehow made us all feel nice and cozy.
We took a break once we reached this "square," putting down our packs, and then
the children went into the woods in groups of three or four in search of mushrooms. I
insisted that they never lose sight of one another. Before they set out, I gathered them all
together and made sure they understood this. We knew the place well, but it was a
woods, after all, and if any of them got separated and lost we'd have a hard time finding
them. Still, you have to remember these are small children, and once they start hunting
mushrooms they tend to forget this rule. So I always made sure that as I looked for
mushrooms myself I kept an eye on them, and a running head count.
It was about ten minutes or so after we began hunting mushrooms that the
children started to collapse.
When I first spotted a group of three of them collapsed on the ground I was sure
they'd eaten poisonous mushrooms. There are a lot of highly toxic mushrooms around
here, even ones that can be fatal. The local kids know which ones not to pick, but a few
varieties are hard to distinguish. That's why I always warned the children never to put
any in their mouths until we got back to school and had an expert check them. But you
can't always expect kids to listen, can you?
I raced over to the spot and lifted up the children who'd fallen to the ground.
Their bodies were limp, like rubber that's been left out in the sun. It was like carrying
empty shells--the strength was completely drained from them. But they were breathing
fine. Their pulses were normal, and none of them had a temperature. They looked calm,
not at all like they were in any pain. I ruled out things like bee stings or snakebites. The
children were simply unconscious.
The strangest thing was their eyes. Their bodies were so limp it was like they
were in a coma, yet their eyes were open as if they were looking at something. They'd
blink every once in a while, so it wasn't like they were asleep. And their eyes moved
very slowly from side to side like they were scanning a distant horizon. Their eyes at
least were conscious. But they weren't actually looking at anything, or at least nothing
visible. I waved my hand a few times in front of their faces, but got no reaction.
I picked up each of the three children in turn, and they were all exactly the same.
All of them were unconscious, their eyes slowly moving from side to side. It was the
weirdest thing I'd ever seen.
--Describe the group that first collapsed.
It was a group of girls. Three girls who were all good friends. I called out their
names and slapped them on the cheek, pretty hard, in fact, but there was no reaction.
They didn't feel a thing. It was a strange feeling, like touching a void.
My first thought was to send somebody running back to the school for help.
There was no way I could carry three unconscious children down by myself. So I started
looking for the fastest runner in the class, one of the boys. But when I stood up and
looked around I saw that all the children had collapsed. All sixteen of them had fallen to
the ground and lost consciousness. The only one still conscious and standing was me. It
was like... a battlefield.
--Did you notice anything unusual at the scene? Any strange smell or sound--or a
light?
[Thinks about it for a while.] No, as I already said, it was very quiet and peaceful.
No unusual sounds or light or smells. The only thing unusual was that every single pupil
in my class had collapsed and was lying there unconscious. I felt utterly alone, like I was
the last person alive on Earth. I can't describe that feeling of total loneliness. I just
wanted to disappear into thin air and not think about anything.
Of course I couldn't do that--I had my duty as a teacher. I pulled myself together
and raced down the slope as fast as my legs would carry me, to get help at the school.
Chapter 3
It's nearly dawn when I wake up. I draw the curtain back and take a look. It must have
just stopped raining, since everything is still wet and drippy. Clouds to the east are
sharply etched against the sky, each one framed by light. The sky looks ominous one
minute, inviting the next. It all depends on the angle.
The bus plows down the highway at a set speed, the tires humming along, never
getting any louder or softer. Same with the engine, its monotonous sound like a mortar
smoothly grinding down time and the consciousness of the people on board. The other
passengers are all sunk back in their seats, asleep, their curtains drawn tight. The driver
and I are the only ones awake. We're being carried, efficiently and numbly, toward our
destination.
Feeling thirsty, I take a bottle of mineral water from the pocket of my backpack
and drink some of the lukewarm water. From the same pocket I pull out a box of soda
crackers and munch a few, enjoying that familiar dry taste. According to my watch it's
4:32. I check the date and day of the week, just to be on the safe side. Thirteen hours
since I left home. Time hasn't leaped ahead more than it should or done an unexpected
about-face. It's still my birthday, still the first day of my brand-new life. I shut my eyes,
open them again, again checking the time and date on my watch. Then I switch on the
reading light, take out a paperback book, and start reading.
Just after five, without warning, the bus pulls off the highway and comes to a stop
in a corner of a roadside rest area. The front door of the bus opens with an airy hiss,
lights blink on inside, and the bus driver makes a brief announcement. "Good morning,
everybody. Hope you had a good rest. We're on schedule and should arrive in our final
stop at Takamatsu Station in about an hour. But we're stopping here for a twenty-minute
break. We'll be leaving again at five-thirty, so please be sure to be back on board by
then."
The announcement wakes up most of the passengers, and they silently struggle to
their feet, yawning as they stumble out of the bus. This is where people make
themselves presentable before arriving in Takamatsu. I get off too, take a couple of deep
breaths, and do some simple stretching exercises in the fresh morning air. I walk over to
the men's room and splash some water on my face. I'm wondering where the heck we
are. I go outside and look around. Nothing special, just the typical roadside scenery you
find next to a highway. Maybe I'm just imagining things, but the shape of the hills and
the color of the trees seem different from those back in Tokyo.
I'm inside the cafeteria sipping a free cup of hot tea when this young girl comes
over and plunks herself down on the plastic seat next to me. In her right hand she has a
paper cup of hot coffee she bought from a vending machine, the steam rising up from it,
and in her left hand she's holding a small container with sandwiches inside--another bit
of vending-machine gourmet fare, by the looks of it.
She's kind of funny looking. Her face is out of balance--broad forehead, button
nose, freckled cheeks, and pointy ears. A slammed-together, rough sort of face you can't
ignore. Still, the whole package isn't so bad. For all I know maybe she's not so wild
about her own looks, but she seems comfortable with who she is, and that's the
important thing. There's something childish about her that has a calming effect, at least
on me. She isn't very tall, but has good-looking legs and a nice bust for such a slim body.
Her thin metal earrings sparkle like duralumin. She wears her dark brown, almost
reddish dyed hair down to her shoulders, and has on a long-sleeved crewneck shirt with
wide stripes. A small leather backpack hangs from one shoulder, and a light sweater's
tied around her neck. A cream-colored miniskirt completes her outfit, with no stockings.
She's evidently washed her face, since a few strands of hair, like the thin roots of a plant,
are plastered to her broad forehead. Strangely enough, those loose strands of hair draw
me to her.
"You were on the bus, weren't you?" she asks me, her voice a little husky.
"Yeah, that's right."
She frowns as she takes a sip of the coffee. "How old are you?"
"Seventeen," I lie.
"So you're in high school."
I nod.
"Where're you headed?"
"Takamatsu."
"Same with me," she says. "Are you visiting, or do you live there?"
"Visiting," I reply.
"Me too. I have a friend there. A girlfriend of mine. How about you?"
"Relatives."
I see, her nod says. No more questions. "I've got a younger brother the same age
as you," she suddenly tells me, as if she'd just remembered. "Things happened, and we
haven't seen each other for a long time.... You know something? You look a lot like that
guy. Anybody ever tell you that?"
"What guy?"
"You know, the guy who sings in that band! As soon as I saw you in the bus I
thought you looked like him, but I just can't come up with his name. I must have busted
a hole in my brain trying to remember. That happens sometimes, right? It's on the tip of
your tongue, but you just can't think of it. Hasn't anybody said that to you before--that
you remind them of somebody?"
I shake my head. Nobody's ever said that to me. She's still staring at me, eyes
narrowed intently. "What kind of person do you mean?" I ask.
"A TV guy."
"A guy who's on TV?"
"Right," she says, picking up her ham sandwich and taking an uninspired bite,
washing it down with a sip of coffee. "A guy who sings in some band. Darn--I can't
think of the band's name, either. This tall guy who has a Kansai accent. You don't have
any idea who I mean?"
"Sorry, I don't watch TV."
The girl frowns and gives me a hard look. "You don't watch at all?"
I shake my head silently. Wait a sec--should I nod or shake my head here? I go
with the nod.
"Not very talkative, are you? One line at a time seems your style. Are you always
so quiet?"
I blush. I'm sort of a quiet type to begin with, but part of the reason I don't want to
say much is that my voice hasn't changed completely. Most of the time I've got kind of a
low voice, but all of a sudden it turns on me and lets out a squeak. So I try to keep
whatever I say short and sweet.
"Anyway," she goes on, "what I'm trying to say is you look a lot like that singer
with the Kansai accent. Not that you have a Kansai accent or anything. It's just--I don't
know, there's something about you that's a lot like him. He seems like a real nice guy,
that's all."
Her smile steps offstage for a moment, then does an encore, all while I'm dealing
with my blushing face. "You'd resemble him even more if you changed your hair," she
says. "Let it grow out a little, use some gel to make it flip up a bit. I'd love to give it a try.
You'd definitely look good like that. Actually, I'm a hairdresser."
I nod and sip my tea. The cafeteria is dead silent. None of the usual background
music, nobody else talking besides the two of us.
"Maybe you don't like talking?" she says, resting her head in one hand and giving
me a serious look.
I shake my head. "No, that's not it."
"You think it's a pain to talk to people?"
One more shake of my head.
She picks up her other sandwich with strawberry jam instead of ham, then frowns
and gives me this look of disbelief. "Would you eat this for me? I hate strawberry-jam
sandwiches more than anything. Ever since I was a kid."
I take it from her. Strawberry-jam sandwiches aren't exactly on my top-ten list
either, but I don't say a word and start eating.
From across the table she watches until I finish every last crumb. "Could you do
me a favor?" she says.
"A favor?"
"Can I sit next to you until we get to Takamatsu? I just can't relax when I sit by
myself. I always feel like some weird person's going to plop himself down next to me,
and then I can't get to sleep. When I bought my ticket they told me they were all single
seats, but when I got on I saw they're all doubles. I just want to catch a few winks before
we arrive, and you seem like a nice guy. Do you mind?"
"No problem."
"Thanks," she says. "'In traveling, a companion,' as the saying goes."
I nod. Nod, nod, nod--that's all I seem capable of. But what should I say?
"How does that end?" she asks.
"How does what end?"
"After a companion, how does it go? I can't remember. I never was very good at
Japanese."
"'In life, compassion,'" I say.
"'In traveling, a companion, in life, compassion,'" she repeats, making sure of it.
If she had paper and pencil, it wouldn't surprise me if she wrote it down. "So what does
that really mean? In simple terms."
I think it over. It takes me a while to gather my thoughts, but she waits patiently.
"I think it means," I say, "that chance encounters are what keep us going. In
simple terms."
She mulls that over for a while, then slowly brings her hands together on top of
the table and rests them there lightly. "I think you're right about that--that chance
encounters keep us going."
I glance at my watch. It's five-thirty already. "Maybe we better be getting back."
"Yeah, I guess so. Let's go," she says, making no move, though, to get up.
"By the way, where are we?" I ask.
"I have no idea," she says. She cranes her neck and sweeps the place with her
eyes. Her earrings jiggle back and forth like two precarious pieces of ripe fruit ready to
fall. "From the time I'm guessing we're near Kurashiki, not that it matters. A rest area on
a highway is just a place you pass through. To get from here to there." She holds up her
right index finger and her left index finger, about twelve inches apart.
"What does it matter what it's called?" she continues. "You've got your restrooms
and your food. Your fluorescent lights and your plastic chairs. Crappy coffee.
Strawberry-jam sandwiches. It's all pointless--assuming you try to find a point to it.
We're coming from somewhere, heading somewhere else. That's all you need to know,
right?"
I nod. And nod. And nod.
When we get back to the bus the other passengers are already aboard, with just us
holding things up. The driver's a young guy with this intense look that reminds me of
some stern watchman. He turns a reproachful gaze on the two of us but doesn't say
anything, and the girl shoots him an innocent sorry-we're-late smile. He reaches out to
push a lever and the door hisses closed. The girl lugs her little suitcase over and sits
down beside me--a nothing kind of suitcase she must've picked up at some discount
place--and I pick it up for her and store it away in the overhead rack. Pretty heavy for its
size. She thanks me, then reclines her seat and fades off to sleep. Like it can barely wait
to get going, the bus starts to roll the instant we get settled. I pull out my paperback and
pick up where I'd left off.
The girl's soon fast asleep, and as the bus sways through each curve her head
leans against my shoulder, finally coming to a rest there. Mouth closed, she's breathing
quietly through her nose, the breath grazing my shoulder at regular beats. I look down
and catch a glimpse of her bra strap through the collar of her crewneck shirt, a thin,
cream-colored strap. I picture the delicate fabric at the end of that strap. The soft breasts
beneath. The pink nipples taut under my fingertips. Not that I'm trying to imagine all
this, but I can't help it. And--no surprise--I get a massive hard-on. So rigid it makes me
wonder how any part of your body could ever get so rock hard.
Just then a thought hits me. Maybe--just maybe--this girl's my sister. She's about
the right age. Her odd looks aren't at all like the girl in the photo, but you can't always
count on that. Depending on how they're taken people sometimes look totally different.
She said she has a brother my age who she hasn't seen in ages. Couldn't that brother be
me--in theory, at least?
I stare at her chest. As she breathes, the rounded peaks move up and down like
the swell of waves, somehow reminding me of rain falling softly on a broad stretch of
sea. I'm the lonely voyager standing on deck, and she's the sea. The sky is a blanket of
gray, merging with the gray sea off on the horizon. It's hard to tell the difference
between sea and sky. Between voyager and sea. Between reality and the workings of the
heart.
The girl wears two rings on her fingers, neither of which is a wedding or
engagement ring, just cheap things you find at those little boutiques girls shop at. Her
fingers are long and thin but look strong, the nails are short and nicely trimmed with a
light pink polish. Her hands are resting lightly on the knees thrust out from her miniskirt.
I want to touch those hands, but of course I don't. Asleep, she looks like a young child.
One pointy ear peeks out from the strands of hair like a little mushroom, looking
strangely fragile.
I shut my book and look for a while at the passing scenery. But very soon, before
I realize it, I fall asleep myself.
Chapter 4
U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE SECTION (MIS) REPORT Dated: May 12, 1946
Title: Report on the Rice Bowl Hill Incident, 1944
Document Number: PTYX-722-8936745-42216-WWN
The following is a taped interview with Doctor Juichi Nakazawa (53), who ran an
internal medicine clinic in [name deleted] Town at the time of the incident. Materials
related to the interview can be accessed using application number PTYX-722-SQ-162 to
183.
Impressions of the interviewer Lt. Robert O'Connor: Doctor Nakazawa is so big
boned and dark skinned he looks more like a farm foreman than a doctor. He has a calm
manner but is very brisk and concise and says exactly what's on his mind. Behind his
glasses his eyes have a very sharp, alert look, and his memory seems reliable.
That's correct--at eleven a.m. on November 7, 1944, I received a phone call from
the assistant principal at the local elementary school. I used to be the school doctor, or
something close to it, so that's why they contacted me first.
The assistant principal was terribly upset. He told me that an entire class had lost
consciousness while on an outing in the hills to pick mushrooms. According to him they
were totally unconscious. Only the teacher in charge had remained conscious, and she'd
run back to school for help just then. She was so flustered I couldn't grasp the whole
situation, though one fact did come through loud and clear: sixteen children had
collapsed in the woods.
The kids were out picking mushrooms, so of course my first thought was that
they'd eaten some poisonous ones and been paralyzed. If that were the case it'd be
difficult to treat. Different varieties of mushrooms have different toxicity levels, and the
treatments vary. The most we could do at the moment would be to pump out their
stomachs. In the case of highly toxic varieties, though, the poison might enter the
bloodstream quickly and we might be too late. Around here, several people a year die
from poison mushrooms.
I stuffed some emergency medicine in my bag and rode my bike over to the
school as fast as I could. The police had been contacted and two policemen were already
there. We knew we had to get the unconscious kids back to town and would need all the
help we could get. Most of the young men were away at war, though, so we set off with
the best we had--myself, the two policemen, an elderly male teacher, the assistant
principal and principal, the school janitor. And of course the homeroom teacher who'd
been with the kids. We grabbed whatever bicycles we could find, but there weren't
enough, so some of us rode two to a bike.
--What time did you arrive at the site?
It was 11:55. I remember since I happened to glance at my watch when we got
there. We rode our bicycles to the bottom of the hill, as far as we could go, then climbed
the rest of the way on foot.
By the time I arrived several children had partially regained consciousness. Three
or four of them, as I recall. But they weren't fully conscious--sort of dizzily on all fours.
The rest of the children were still collapsed. After a while some of the others began to
come around, their bodies undulating like so many big worms. It was a very strange
sight. The children had collapsed in an odd, flat, open space in the woods where it
looked like all the trees had been neatly removed, with autumn sunlight shining down
brightly. And here you had, in this spot or at the edges of it, sixteen elementary-school
kids scattered about prostrate on the ground, some of them starting to move, some of
them completely still. The whole thing reminded me of some weird avant-garde play.
For a moment I forgot that I was supposed to treat the kids and just stood there,
frozen, staring at the scene. Not just myself--everyone in the rescue group reacted the
same, paralyzed for a while by what they saw. This might be a strange way of putting it,
perhaps, but it was like some mistake had occurred that allowed us to see a sight people
should never see. It was wartime, and I was always mentally prepared, as a physician, to
deal with whatever came, in the remote possibility that something awful would occur
way out here in the country. Prepared as a citizen of Japan to calmly do my duty if the
need arose. But when I saw this scene in the woods I literally froze.
I soon snapped out of it, and picked up one of the children, a little girl. Her body
had no strength in it at all and was limp as a rag doll. Her breathing was steady but she
was still unconscious. Her eyes, though, were open, tracking something back and forth. I
pulled a small flashlight out of my bag and shined it on her pupils. Completely
unreactive. Her eyes were functioning, watching something, yet showed no response to
light. I picked up several other children and examined them and they were all exactly the
same, unresponsive. I found this quite odd.
I next checked their pulse and temperature. Their pulses were between 50 and 55,
and all of them had temperatures just below 97 degrees. Somewhere around 96 degrees
or thereabouts, as I recall. That's correct--for children of that age this pulse rate is well
below normal, the body temperature over one degree below average. I smelled their
breath, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Likewise with their throats and
tongues.
I immediately ascertained these weren't the symptoms of food poisoning. Nobody
had vomited or suffered diarrhea, and none of them seemed to be in any pain. If the
children had eaten something bad you could expect--with this much time having
elapsed--the onset of at least one of these symptoms. I heaved a sigh of relief that it
wasn't food poisoning. But then I was stumped, since I hadn't a clue what was wrong
with them.
The symptoms were similar to sunstroke. Kids often collapse from this in the
summer. It's like it's contagious--once one of them collapses their friends all do the same,
one after the other. But this was November, in a cool woods, no less. One or two getting
sunstroke is one thing, but sixteen children simultaneously coming down with it was out
of the question.
My next thought was some kind of poison gas or nerve gas, either naturally
occurring or man-made. But how in the world could gas appear in the middle of the
woods in such a remote part of the country? I couldn't account for it. Poison gas, though,
would logically explain what I saw that day. Everyone breathed it in, went unconscious,
and collapsed on the spot. The homeroom teacher didn't collapse because the
concentration of gas wasn't strong enough to affect an adult.
But when it came to treating the children, I was totally lost. I'm just a simple
country doctor and have no special expertise in poison gasses, so I was out of my league.
We were out in this remote town and I couldn't very well ring up a specialist. Very
gradually, in fact, some of the children were getting better, and I figured that perhaps
with time they would all regain consciousness. I know it's an overly optimistic view, but
at the time I couldn't think of anything else to do. So I suggested that we just let them lie
there quietly for a while and see what developed.
--Was there anything unusual in the air?
I was concerned about that myself, so I took several deep breaths to see if I could
detect any unusual odor. But it was just the ordinary smell of a woods in the hills. It was
a bracing scent, the fragrance of trees. Nothing unusual about the plants and flowers
around there, either. Nothing had changed shape or been discolored.
One by one I examined the mushrooms the children had been picking. There
weren't all that many, which led me to conclude that they'd collapsed not long after they
began picking them. All of them were typical edible mushrooms. I've been a doctor here
for some time and am quite familiar with the different varieties. Of course to be on the
safe side I collected them all and took them back and had a specialist examine them. But
as far as I could tell, they were all ordinary, edible mushrooms.
--You said the unconscious children's eyes moved back and forth, but did you
notice any other unusual symptoms or reactions? For instance, the size of their pupils,
the color of the whites of their eyes, the frequency of their blinking?
No. Other than their eyes moving back and forth like a searchlight, there was
nothing out of the ordinary. All other functions were completely normal. The children
were looking at something. To put a finer point on it, the children weren't looking at
what we could see, but something we couldn't. It was more like they were observing
something rather than just looking at it. They were essentially expressionless, but overall
they seemed calm, not afraid or in any pain. That's also one of the reasons I decided to
just let them lie there and see how things played out. I decided if they're not in any pain,
then just let them be for a while.
--Did anyone mention the idea that the children had been gassed?
Yes, they did. But like me they couldn't figure out how it was possible. I mean,
no one had ever heard of somebody going on a hike in the woods and ending up getting
gassed. Then one of the people there--the assistant principal, I believe it was--said it
might have been gas dropped by the Americans. They must have dropped a bomb with
poison gas, he said. The homeroom teacher recalled seeing what looked like a B-29 in
the sky just before they started up the hill, flying right overhead. That's it! everyone said,
some new poison gas bomb the Americans developed. Rumors about the Americans
developing a new kind of bomb had even reached our neck of the woods. But why
would the Americans drop their newest weapon in such an out-of-the-way place? That
we couldn't explain. But mistakes are part of life, and some things we aren't meant to
understand, I suppose.
--After this, then, the children gradually recovered on their own?
They did. I can't tell you how relieved I was. At first they started squirming
around, then they sat up unsteadily, gradually regaining consciousness. No one
complained of any pain during this process. It was all very quiet, like they were waking
up from a deep sleep. And as they regained consciousness their eye movements became
normal again. They showed normal reactions to light when I shined a flashlight in their
eyes. It took some time, though, for them to be able to speak again--just like you are
when you first wake up.
We asked each of the children what had happened, but they looked dumbfounded,
like we were asking about something they didn't remember taking place. Going up the
hill, starting to gather mushrooms--that much they recalled. Everything after that was a
total blank. They had no sense of any time passing between then and now. They start
gathering mushrooms, then the curtain falls, and here they are lying on the ground,
surrounded by all these adults. The children couldn't figure out why we were all upset,
staring at them with these worried looks on our faces. They seemed more afraid of us
than anything else.
Sadly, there was one child, a boy, who didn't regain consciousness. One of the
children evacuated from Tokyo. Satoru Nakata, I believe his name was. A small, pale
little boy. He was the only one who remained unconscious. He just lay there on the
ground, his eyes moving back and forth. We had to carry him back down the hill. The
other children walked back down like nothing had happened.
--Other than this boy, Nakata, none of the other children showed any symptoms
later on?
As far as any outward signs at least, no, they displayed no unusual symptoms. No
one complained of pain or discomfort. As soon as we got back to the school I brought
the children into the nurse's room one by one and examined them--took their
temperature, listened to their heart with a stethoscope, checked their vision. Whatever I
was able to do at the time I did. I had them solve some simple arithmetic problems,
stand on one foot with their eyes closed, things like that. Physically they were fine. They
didn't seem tired and had healthy appetites. They'd missed lunch so they all said they
were hungry. We gave them rice balls to eat, and they gobbled them up.
A few days later I stopped by the school to observe how the children were doing.
I called a few of them into the nurse's room and questioned them. Again, though,
everything seemed fine. No traces remained, physically or emotionally, from their
strange experience. They couldn't even remember that it had happened. Their lives were
completely back to normal, unaffected by the incident. They attended class as usual,
sang songs, played outside during recess, everything normal kids did. Their homeroom
teacher, however, was a different story: she still seemed in shock.
But that one boy, Nakata, didn't regain consciousness, so the following day he
was taken to the university hospital in Kofu. After that he was transferred to a military
hospital, and never came back to our town again. I never heard what became of him.
This incident never made the newspapers. My guess is the authorities decided it
would only cause unrest, so they banned any mention of it. You have to remember that
during the war the military tried to squelch whatever they saw as groundless rumors.
The war wasn't going well, with the military retreating on the southern front, suicide
attacks one after the other, air raids on cities getting worse all the time. The military was
especially afraid of any antiwar or pacifist sentiment cropping up among the populace.
A few days after the incident the police came calling and warned us that under no
circumstances were we to talk about what we'd seen.
The whole thing was an odd, unpleasant affair. Even to this day it's like a weight
pressing down on me.
Chapter 5
I'm asleep when our bus drives across the huge new bridge over the Inland Sea. I'd seen
the bridge only on maps and had been looking forward to seeing it for real. Somebody
gently taps me on the shoulder and I wake up.
"Hey, we're here," the girl says.
I stretch, rub my eyes with the back of my hand, and look out the window. Sure
enough, the bus is just pulling into what looks like the square in front of a station. Fresh
morning sunlight lights up the scene. Almost blinding, but gentle somehow, the light is
different from what I was used to in Tokyo. I glance at my watch .6:32.
"Gosh, what a long trip," she says tiredly. "I thought my lower back was going to
give out. And my neck's killing me. You aren't going to catch me on an all-night bus
again. I'm taking the plane from now on, even if it's more expensive. Turbulence,
hijackings--I don't care. Give me a plane any day."
I lower her suitcase and my backpack from the overhead rack. "What's your
name?" I ask.
"My name?"
"Yeah."
"Sakura," she says. "What about you?"
"Kafka Tamura," I reply.
"Kafka Tamura," she muses. "Weird name. Easy to remember, though."
I nod. Becoming a different person might be hard, but taking on a different name
is a cinch.
She gets off the bus, sets her suitcase on the ground, and plunks herself down on
top, then pulls a notebook from a pocket in her small backpack, scribbles down
something, rips the page out, and hands it to me. A phone number, by the looks of it.
"My cell phone number," she says with a wry expression. "I'm staying at my
friend's place for a while, but if you ever feel like seeing somebody, give me a call. We
can go out for a bite or whatever. Don't be a stranger, okay? 'Even chance meetings'...
how does the rest of that go?"
"'Are the result of karma.'"
"Right, right," she says. "But what does it mean?"
"That things in life are fated by our previous lives. That even in the smallest
events there's no such thing as coincidence."
She sits there on her yellow suitcase, notebook in hand, giving it some thought.
"Hmm... that's a kind of philosophy, isn't it. Not such a bad way of thinking about life.
Sort of a reincarnation, New Age kind of thing. But, Kafka, remember this, okay? I don't
go around giving my cell phone number to just anybody. You know what I mean?"
I appreciate it, I tell her. I fold up the piece of paper and stick it in the pocket of
my windbreaker. Thinking better of it, I transfer it to my wallet.
"So how long'll you be in Takamatsu?" Sakura asks.
"I don't know yet," I say. "It depends on how things go."
She gazes intently at me, her head tilted slightly to one side. Okay, whatever, she
might be thinking. She climbs into a cab, gives a little wave, and takes off.
Once again I'm all alone. Sakura, I think--not my sister's name. But names are
changed easily enough. Especially when you're trying to try to run away from somebody.
I have a reservation at a business hotel in Takamatsu. The YMCA in Tokyo had
told me about the place, and through them I got a discount on the room. But that's only
for the first three days, then it goes back to the normal room rate.
If I really wanted to save money, I could just sack out on a bench in front of the
station, or since it's still warm out, I could sleep in my sleeping bag in a park somewhere.
But then the cops will come and card me--the one thing I have to avoid at all costs.
That's why I went for the hotel reservation, at least for three days. After that I'll figure
something out.
At the station I pop into the first little diner that catches my eye, and eat my fill of
udon. Born and raised in Tokyo, I haven't had much udon in my life. But now I'm in
Udon Central--Shikoku--and confronted with noodles like nothing I've ever seen.
They're chewy and fresh, and the soup smells great, really fragrant. And talk about
cheap. It all tastes so good I order seconds, and for the first time in who knows how long,
I'm happily stuffed. Afterward I plop myself down on a bench in the plaza next to the
station and gaze up at the sunny sky. I'm free, I remind myself. Like the clouds floating
across the sky, I'm all by myself, totally free.
I decide to kill time till evening at a library. Ever since I was little I've loved to
spend time in the reading rooms of libraries, so I've come to Takamatsu armed with info
on all the libraries in and around the city. Think about it--a little kid who doesn't want to
go home doesn't have many places he can go. Coffee shops and movie theaters are offlimits.
That leaves only libraries, and they're perfect--no entrance fee, nobody getting all
hot and bothered if a kid comes in. You just sit down and read whatever you want. I
always rode my bike to the local public library after school. Even on holidays that's
where you'd find me. I'd devour anything and everything--novels, biographies, histories,
whatever was lying around. Once I'd gone through all the children's books, I went on to
the general stacks and books for adults. I might not always get much out of them, but I
forged on to the very last page. When I got tired of reading I'd go into one of those
listening booths with headphones and enjoy some music. I had no idea about music so I
just went down the row of CDs they had there, giving them all a listen. That's how I got
to know about Duke Ellington, the Beatles, and Led Zeppelin.
The library was like a second home. Or maybe more like a real home, more than
the place I lived in. By going every day I got to know all the lady librarians who worked
there. They knew my name and always said hi. I was painfully shy, though, and could
barely reply.
Before coming to Takamatsu I found out some wealthy man from an old family in
the suburbs had renovated his personal library into a private library open to the public.
The place has a lot of rare books, and I heard that the building itself and the surrounding
garden were worth checking out. I saw a photo of the place once in Taiyo magazine. It's
a large, Japanese-style house with this really elegant reading room that looks more like a
parlor, where people are sitting with their books on comfortable-looking sofas. For some
reason that photo really stayed with me, and I wanted to see this in person if someday
the chance came along. The Komura Memorial Library, the place was called.
I go over to the tourist information booth at the station and ask how to get there.
A pleasant middle-aged lady marks the spot on a tourist map and gives me instructions
on which train to take. It's about a twenty-minute ride, she explains. I thank her and
study the schedule posted inside the station. Trains run about every twenty minutes. I
have some time, so I pick up a takeout lunch at one of the little shops.
The train is just two little cars coupled together. The tracks cut through a highrise
shopping district, then past a mix of small shops and houses, factories and
warehouses. Next comes a park and an apartment building under construction. I press
my face against the window, drinking in the unfamiliar sights. I've hardly ever been
outside of Tokyo, and everything looks fresh and new. The train I'm on, going out of
town, is nearly empty this time of the morning, but the platforms on the other side are
packed with junior and senior high school kids in summer uniforms, schoolbags slung
across their shoulders. All heading to school. Not me, though. I'm alone, going in the
opposite direction. We're on different tracks in more ways than one. All of a sudden the
air feels thin and something heavy is bearing down on my chest. Am I really doing the
right thing? The thought makes me feel helpless, isolated. I turn my back on the
schoolkids and try not to look at them anymore.
The train runs along the sea for a time, then cuts inland. We pass tall fields of
corn, grapevines, tangerine trees growing on terraced hills. An occasional irrigation
pond sparkles in the sunlight. A river winding through a flat stretch of land looks cool
and inviting, an empty lot is overgrown with summer grasses. At one point we pass a
dog standing by the tracks, staring vacantly at the train rushing by. Watching this
scenery makes me feel warm and calm all over again. You're going to be okay, I tell
myself, taking a deep breath. All you can do is forge on ahead.
At the station I follow the map and walk north past rows of old stores and houses.
Both sides of the street are lined with walls around people's homes. I've never seen so
many different kinds--black walls made out of boards, white walls, granite block walls,
stone walls with hedges on top. The whole place is still and silent, with no one else on
the street. Hardly any cars pass by. The air smells like the sea, which must be nearby. I
listen carefully but can't hear any waves. Far off, though, I hear the faint bee-like buzz
of an electric saw, maybe from a construction site. Small signs with arrows pointing
toward the library line the road from the station, so I can't get lost.
Right in front of the Komura Memorial Library's imposing front gate stand two
neatly trimmed plum trees. Inside the gate a gravel path winds past other beautifully
manicured bushes and trees--pines and magnolias, kerria and azaleas--with not a fallen
leaf in sight. A couple of stone lanterns peek out between the trees, as does a small pond.
Finally I get to the intricately designed entrance. I come to a halt in front of the open
front door, hesitating for a moment about going inside. This place doesn't look like any
library I've ever seen. But having come all this way I might as well take the plunge. Just
inside the entrance a young man is sitting behind a counter where you check your bags. I
slough off my backpack, then take off my sunglasses and cap.
"Is this your first visit?" he asks me in a relaxed, quiet voice. It's slightly highpitched,
but smooth and soothing.
I nod, but the words don't come. The question takes me by surprise and makes me
kind of tense.
A long, freshly sharpened pencil between his fingers, the young man gazes
intently at my face for a while. The pencil is yellow, with an eraser at the end. The man's
face is on the small side, his features regular. Pretty, rather than handsome, might
describe him best. He's wearing a button-down white cotton shirt and olive green chinos,
with not a single wrinkle on either. When he looks down his longish hair falls over his
brow, and occasionally he notices this and fingers it back. His sleeves are rolled up to
the elbows, revealing slender white wrists. Delicately framed glasses nicely complement
his features. The small plastic name tag pinned to his chest says Oshima. Not exactly the
type of librarian I'm used to.
"Feel free to use the stacks," he tells me, "and if you find a book you'd like to read,
just bring it to the reading room. Rare books have a red seal on them, and for those
you'll need to fill out a request card. Over there to the right is the reference room.
There's a card index and a computer you can use to search for material. We don't allow
any books to be checked out. We don't carry any magazines or newspapers. No cameras
are allowed. And neither is making copies of anything. All food and beverages should
be consumed outside on the benches. And we close at five." He lays his pencil on the
desk and adds, "Are you in high school?"
"Yes, I am," I say after taking a deep breath.
"This library is a little different from the ones you're probably used to," he says.
"We specialize in certain genres of books, mainly old books by tanka and haiku poets.
Naturally, we have a selection of general books as well. Most of the people who ride the
train all the way out here are doing research in those fields. No one comes here to read
the latest Stephen King novel. We might get the occasional graduate student, but very
seldom someone your age. So--are you researching tanka or haiku, then?"
"No," I answer.
"That's what I thought."
"Is it still okay for me to use the library?" I ask timidly, trying to keep my voice
from cracking.
"Of course." He smiles and places both hands on the desk. "This is a library, and
anybody who wants to read is welcome. This can be our little secret, but I'm not
particularly fond of tanka or haiku myself."
"It's a really beautiful building," I say.
He nods. "The Komura family's been a major sake producer since the Edo
period," he explains, "and the previous head of the family was quite a bibliophile,
nationally famous for scouring the country in search of books. His father was himself a
tanka poet, and many writers used to stop by here when they came to Shikoku.
Wakayama Bokusui, for instance, or Ishikawa Takuboku, and Shiga Naoya. Some of
them must have found it quite comfortable here, because they stayed a long time. All in
all, the family spared no expense when it came to the literary arts. What usually happens
with a family like that is eventually a descendant squanders the inheritance, but
fortunately the Komuras avoided that fate. They enjoyed their hobby, in its place, but
made sure the family business did well."
"So they were rich," I say, stating the obvious.
"Very much so." His lips curve ever so slightly. "They aren't as rich now as they
were before the war, but they're still pretty wealthy. Which is why they can maintain
such a wonderful library. Of course making it a foundation helps lower their inheritance
tax, but that's another story. If you're really interested in this building I suggest you take
the little tour at two. It's only once a week, on Tuesdays, which happens to be today.
There's a rather unique collection of paintings and drawings on the second floor, and the
building itself is, architecturally, quite fascinating. I know you'll enjoy it."
"Thank you," I say.
You're quite welcome, his smile suggests. He picks his pencil up again and starts
tapping the eraser end on the desk like he's gently encouraging me.
"Are you the one who does the tour?"
Oshima smiles. "No, I'm just a lowly assistant, I'm afraid. A lady named Miss
Saeki is in charge here--my boss. She's related to the Komuras and does the tour herself.
I know you'll like her. She's a wonderful person."
I go into the high-ceilinged stacks and wander among the shelves, searching for a
book that looks interesting. Magnificent thick beams run across the ceiling of the room,
and gentle early-summer sunlight is shining through the open window, the chatter of
birds in the garden filtering in. The books in the shelves in front of me, sure enough, are
just like Oshima said, mainly books of Japanese poetry. Tanka and haiku, essays on
poetry, biographies of various poets. There are also a lot of books on local history. A
shelf farther back contains general humanities--collections of Japanese literature, world
literature, and individual writers, classics, philosophy, drama, art history, sociology,
history, biography, geography.... When I open them, most of the books have the smell of
an earlier time leaking out between the pages--a special odor of the knowledge and
emotions that for ages have been calmly resting between the covers. Breathing it in, I
glance through a few pages before returning each book to its shelf.
Finally I decide on a multivolume set, with beautiful covers, of the Burton
translation of The Arabian Nights, pick out one volume, and take it back to the reading
room. I've been meaning to read this book. Since the library has just opened for the day,
there's no one else there and I have the elegant reading room all to myself. It's exactly
like in the photo in the magazine--roomy and comfortable, with a high ceiling. Every
once in a while a gentle breeze blows in through the open window, the white curtain
rustling softly in air that has a hint of the sea. And I love the comfortable sofa. An old
upright piano stands in a corner, and the whole place makes me feel like I'm in some
friend's home.
As I relax on the sofa and gaze around the room a thought hits me: This is exactly
the place I've been looking for forever. A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere.
I'd always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it
actually exists. I close my eyes and take a breath, and like a gentle cloud the wonder of
it all settles over me. I slowly stroke the creamish cover of the sofa, then stand up and
walk over to the piano and lift the cover, laying all ten fingers down on the slightly
yellowed keys. I shut the cover and walk across the faded grape-patterned carpet to the
window and test the antique handle that opens and closes it. I switch the floor lamp on
and off, then check out all the paintings hanging on the walls. Finally I plop back down
on the sofa and pick up reading where I left off, focusing on The Arabian Nights for a
while.
At noon I take my bottle of mineral water and box lunch out to the veranda that
faces the garden and sit down to eat. Different kinds of birds fly overhead, fluttering
from one tree to the next or flying down to the pond to drink and groom themselves.
There are some I've never seen before. A large brown cat makes an appearance, which is
their signal to clear out of there, even though the cat looks like he couldn't care less
about birds. All he wants is to stretch out on the stepping stones and enjoy the warm
sunlight.
"Is your school closed today?" Oshima asks when I drop off my backpack on my
way back to the reading room.
"No," I reply, carefully choosing my words, "I just decided to take some time
off."
"Refusing to go to school," he says.
"I guess so."
Oshima looks at me with great interest. "You guess so."
"I'm not refusing to go to school. I just decided not to."
"Very calmly, all on your own, you stopped going to school?"
I merely nod. I have no idea how to reply.
"According to Aristophanes in Plato's Symposium, in the ancient world of myth
there were three types of people," Oshima says. "Have you heard about this?"
"No."
"In ancient times people weren't just male or female, but one of three types:
male/male, male/female, or female/female. In other words, each person was made out of
the components of two people. Everyone was happy with this arrangement and never
really gave it much thought. But then God took a knife and cut everybody in half, right
down the middle. So after that the world was divided just into male and female, the
upshot being that people spend their time running around trying to locate their missing
other half."
"Why did God do that?"
"Divide people into two? You got me. God works in mysterious ways. There's
that whole wrath-of-God thing, all that excessive idealism and so on. My guess is it was
punishment for something. Like in the Bible. Adam and Eve and the Fall and so forth."
"Original sin," I say.
"That's right, original sin." Oshima holds his pencil between his middle and index
fingers, twirling it ever so slightly as if testing the balance. "Anyway, my point is that
it's really hard for people to live their lives alone."
Back in the reading room I return to "The Tale of Abu-l-Hasan, the Wag," but my
mind wanders away from the book. Male/male, male/female, and female/female?
At two o'clock I lay down my book and get up from the sofa to join the tour of the
building. Miss Saeki, leading the tour, is a slim woman I'd guess is in her mid-forties.
She's a little on the tall side for someone of her generation. She's wearing a blue halfsleeved
dress and a cream-colored cardigan, and has excellent posture. Her long hair is
loosely tied back, her face very refined and intelligent looking, with beautiful eyes and a
shadowy smile playing over her lips, a smile whose sense of completeness is
indescribable. It reminds me of a small, sunny spot, the special patch of sunlight you
find only in some remote, secluded place. My house back in Tokyo has one just like that
in the garden, and ever since I was little I loved that bright little spot.
She makes a strong impression on me, making me feel wistful and nostalgic.
Wouldn't it be great if this were my mother? But I think the same thing every time I run
across a charming, middle-aged woman. The chances that Miss Saeki's actually my
mother are close to zero, I realize. Still, since I have no idea what my mother looks like,
or even her name, the possibility does exist, right? There's nothing that rules it out
completely.
The only other people taking the tour are a middle-aged couple from Osaka. The
wife is short and pudgy with glasses as thick as a Coke bottle. The husband's a skinny
guy with hair so stiff I bet he needs a wire brush to tame it. With narrow eyes and a
broad forehead, he reminds me of some statue on a southern island, eyes fixed on the
horizon. The wife keeps up a one-sided conversation, her husband just grunting out a
monosyllable every once in a while to let her know he's still alive. Other than that, he
gives the occasional nod to show he's properly impressed or else mutters some
fragmentary comment I can't catch. Both of them are dressed more for mountain
climbing than for visiting a library, each wearing a waterproof vest with a million
pockets, sturdy lace-up boots, and hiking hats. Maybe this is how they always dress
when they go on a trip, who knows. They seem okay--not that I'd want them as parents
or anything--and I'm relieved not to be the only one taking the tour.
Miss Saeki begins by explaining the library's history--basically the same story
Oshima told me. How they opened to the public the books and paintings the umpteenth
head of the family had collected, devoting the library to the region's cultural
development. A foundation was set up based on the Komura fortune and now managed
the library and occasionally sponsored lectures, chamber music concerts, and the like.
The building itself dated from the early Meiji period, when it was built to serve double
duty as the family library and guesthouse. In the Taisho period it was completely
renovated as a two-story building, with the addition of magnificent guest rooms for
visiting writers and artists. From the Taisho to the early Showa period, many famous
artists visited the Komuras, leaving behind mementos--poems, sketches, and paintings--
in gratitude for having been allowed to stay here.
"You'll be able to view some selected items from this valuable collection in the
second-floor gallery," Miss Saeki adds. "Before World War II, a vibrant local culture
was established less through the efforts of local government than those of wealthy
connoisseurs such as the Komura family. They were, in short, patrons of the arts.
Kagawa Prefecture has produced quite a number of talented tanka and haiku poets, and
one reason for this was the dedication with which the Komura family founded and
supported the local art scene. Quite a number of books, essays, and reminiscences have
been published on the history of these fascinating artistic circles, all of which are in our
reading room. I hope you'll take the opportunity to look at them.
"The heads of the Komura family down through the years have been well versed
in the arts, with an especially refined appreciation of the truly excellent. This might have
run in the blood. They were very discerning patrons of the arts, supporting artists with
the highest aims who produced the most outstanding works. But as you're surely aware,
in the arts there is no such thing as an absolutely perfect eye. Unfortunately, some
exceptional artists did not win their favor or were not received by them as they deserved
to be. One of these was the haiku poet Taneda Santoka. According to the guestbook,
Santoka stayed here on numerous occasions, each time leaving behind poems and
drawings. The head of the family, however, called him a 'beggar and a braggart,'
wouldn't have much to do with him, and in fact threw away most of these works."
"What a terrible waste," the lady from Osaka says, apparently truly sorry to hear
this. "Nowadays Santoka fetches a hefty price."
"You're exactly right," Miss Saeki says, beaming. "But at the time, he was an
unknown, so perhaps it couldn't be helped. There are many things we only see clearly in
retrospect."
"You got that right," the husband pipes in.
After this Miss Saeki guides us around the first floor, showing us the stacks, the
reading room, the rare-books collection.
"When he built this library, the head of the family decided not to follow the
simple and elegant style favored by artists in Kyoto, instead choosing a design more like
a rustic dwelling. Still, as you can see, in contrast to the bold structure of the building,
the furnishings and picture frames are quite elaborate and luxurious. The carving of
these wooden panels, for instance, is very elegant. All the finest master craftsmen in
Shikoku were assembled to work on the construction."
Our little group starts upstairs, a vaulted ceiling soaring over the staircase. The
ebony railing's so highly polished it looks like you'll leave a mark if you touch it. On a
stained-glass window next to the landing, a deer stretches out its neck to nibble at some
grapes. There are two parlors on the second floor, as well as a spacious hall that in the
past was probably lined with tatami for banquets and gatherings. Now the floor is plain
wood, and the walls are covered with framed calligraphy, hanging scrolls, and Japanesestyle
paintings. In the center, a glass case displays various mementos and the story
behind each. One parlor is in the Japanese style, the other Western. The Western-style
room contains a large writing desk and a swivel chair that look like someone's still using.
There's a line of pines outside the window behind the desk, and the horizon's faintly
visible between the trees.
The couple from Osaka walks around the parlor, inspecting all the items, reading
the explanations in the pamphlet. Every time the wife makes a comment, the husband
chimes in to second her opinion. A lucky couple that agrees on everything. The things
on display don't do much for me, so I check out the details of the building's construction.
While I'm nosing around the Western parlor Miss Saeki comes up to me and says, "You
can sit in that chair, if you'd like to. Shiga Naoya and Tanizaki both sat there at one time
or another. Not that this is the same chair, of course."
I sit down on the swivel chair and quietly rest my hands on the desk.
"How is it? Feel like you could write something?"
I blush a little and shake my head. Miss Saeki laughs and goes back to the couple.
From the chair I watch how she carries herself, every motion natural and elegant. I can't
express it well, but there's definitely something special about it, as if her retreating
figure is trying to tell me something she couldn't express while facing me. But what this
is, I haven't a clue. Face it, I remind myself--there're tons of things you don't have a clue
about.
Still seated, I give the room a once-over. On the wall is an oil painting, apparently
of the seashore nearby. It's done in an old-fashioned style, but the colors are fresh and
alive. On top of the desk is a large ashtray and a lamp with a green lampshade. I push
the switch and, sure enough, the light comes on. A black clock hangs on the opposite
wall, an antique by the looks of it, though the hands tell the right time. There are round
spots worn here and there into the wooden floor, and it creaks slightly when you walk
on it.
At the end of the tour the Osaka couple thanks Miss Saeki and disappears. It turns
out they're members of a tanka circle in the Kansai region. I wonder what kind of poems
they compose--the husband, especially. Grunts and nods don't add up to poetry. But
maybe writing poetry brings out some hidden talent in the guy.
I return to the reading room and pick up where I'd left off in my book. Over the
afternoon a few other readers filter in, most of them with those reading glasses old
people wear and that everybody looks the same in. Time passes slowly. Nobody says a
word, everyone lost in quiet reading. One person sits at a desk jotting down notes, but
the rest are sitting there silently, not moving, totally absorbed. Just like me.
At five o'clock I shut my book and put it back on the shelf. At the exit I ask,
"What time do you open in the morning?"
"Eleven," Oshima replies. "Planning on coming back tomorrow?"
"If it's no bother."
Oshima narrows his eyes as he looks at me. "Of course not. A library's a place for
people who want to read. I'd be happy if you came back. I hope you don't mind my
asking, but do you always carry that backpack with you? It looks pretty heavy. What in
the world could be inside? A stack of Krugerrands, perhaps?"
I blush.
"Don't worry--I'm not really trying to find out." Oshima presses the eraser end of
his pencil against his right temple. "Well, see you tomorrow."
"Bye," I say.
Instead of raising his hand, he lifts his pencil in farewell.
I take the train back to Takamatsu Station. For dinner I stop inside a cheap diner
near the station and order chicken cutlet and a salad. I have a second helping of rice and
a glass of warm milk after the meal. At a mini-mart outside I buy a bottle of mineral
water and two rice balls in case I get hungry in the middle of the night, then start for my
hotel. I walk not too fast or too slow, at an ordinary pace just like everybody else, so no
one notices me.
The hotel is pretty large, a typical second-rate business hotel. I fill in the register
at the front desk, giving Kafka instead of my real first name, a phony address and age,
and pay for one night. I'm a little nervous, but none of the clerks seem suspicious.
Nobody yells out, Hey, we can see right through your ruse, you little fifteen-year-old
runaway! Everything goes smooth as silk, business as usual.
The elevator clanks ominously to the sixth floor. The room is minuscule, outfitted
with an uninviting bed, a rock-hard pillow, a miniature excuse for a desk, a tiny TV,
sun-bleached curtains. The bathroom is barely the size of a closet, with none of those
little complimentary shampoo or conditioner bottles. The view out the window is of the
wall of the building next door. I shouldn't complain, though, since I have a roof over my
head and hot water coming out of the tap. I plunk my backpack on the floor, sit down on
the chair, and try to acclimatize myself to the surroundings.
I'm free, I think. I shut my eyes and think hard and deep about how free I am, but
I can't really understand what it means. All I know is I'm totally alone. All alone in an
unfamiliar place, like some solitary explorer who's lost his compass and his map. Is this
what it means to be free? I don't know, and I give up thinking about it.
I take a long, hot bath and carefully brush my teeth in front of the sink. I flop
down in bed and read, and when I get tired of that I watch the news on TV. Compared to
everything I've gone through that day, though, the news seems stale and boring. I switch
off the TV and get under the covers. It's ten p. m., but I can't get to sleep. A new day in a
brand-new place. And my fifteenth birthday, besides--most of which I spent in that
charming, offbeat library. I met a few new people. Sakura. Oshima. Miss Saeki. Nobody
threatening, thank God. A good omen?
I think about my home back in Nogata, in Tokyo, and my father. How did he feel
when he found I'd suddenly disappeared? Relieved, maybe? Confused? Or maybe
nothing at all. I'm betting he hasn't even noticed I'm gone.
I suddenly remember my father's cell phone and take it out of my backpack. I
switch it on and dial my home number. It starts ringing, 450 miles away, as clearly as if
I were calling the room next door. Startled by this, I hang up after two rings. My heart
won't stop pounding. The phone still works, which means my father hasn't canceled the
contract. Maybe he hasn't noticed the phone's missing from his desk. I shove the phone
back in the pocket of my backpack, turn off the light, and close my eyes. I don't dream.
Come to think of it, I haven't had any dreams in a long time.
Chapter 6
Hello there," the old man called out.
The large, elderly black tomcat raised its head a fraction and wearily returned the
greeting in a low voice.
"A very nice spell of weather we're having."
"Um," the cat said.
"Not a cloud in the sky."
"... for the time being."
"Is the weather going to take a turn for the worse, then?"
"It feels like it'll cloud up toward evening." The black cat slowly stretched out a
leg, then narrowed its eyes and gave the old man another good long look.
With a big grin on his face, the man stared right back. The cat hesitated for a time,
then plunged ahead and spoke. "Hmm... so you're able to speak."
"That's right," the old man said bashfully. To show his respect, he took off his
threadbare cotton hiking hat. "Not that I can speak to every cat I meet, but if things go
well I can. Like right now."
"Interesting," the cat said simply.
"Do you mind if I sit down here for a while? Nakata's a little tired from walking."
The black cat languidly rose to its feet, whiskers atwitch, and yawned so
tremendously its jaw looked almost unhinged. "I don't mind. Or perhaps I should say it's
not up to me. You can sit anywhere you like. Nobody's going to bother you for that."
"Thank you kindly," the man said, lowering himself down beside the cat. "Boy oh
boy, I've been walking since six this morning."
"Um... I take it, then, that you're Mr. Nakata?"
"That's right. Nakata's the name. And you would be?"
"I forget my name," the cat said. "I had one, I know I did, but somewhere along
the line I didn't need it anymore. So it's slipped my mind."
"I know. It's easy to forget things you don't need anymore. Nakata's exactly the
same way," the man said, scratching his head. "So what you're saying, Mr. Cat, is that
you don't belong to some family somewhere?"
"A long time ago I did. But not anymore. Some families in the neighborhood give
me food to eat now and then, but none of them own me."
Nakata nodded and was silent for a time, then said, "Would you mind very much,
then, if I called you Otsuka?"
"Otsuka?" the cat said, looking at him in surprise. "What are you talking about?
Why do I have to be Otsuka?"
"No special reason. The name just came to me. Nakata just picked one out of a
hat. It makes things a lot easier for me if you have a name. That way somebody like me,
who isn't very bright, can organize things better. For instance, I can say, On this day of
this month I spoke with the black cat Otsuka in a vacant lot in the 2-chome
neighborhood. It helps me remember."
"Interesting," the cat said. "Not that I totally follow you. Cats can get by without
names. We go by smell, shape, things of this nature. As long as we know these things,
there're no worries for us."
"Nakata understands completely. But you know, Mr. Otsuka, people don't work
that way. We need dates and names to remember all kinds of things."
The cat gave a snort. "Sounds like a pain to me."
"You're absolutely right. There's so much we have to remember, it is a pain.
Nakata has to remember the name of the Governor, bus numbers. Still, you don't mind if
I call you Otsuka? Maybe it's a little unpleasant for you?"
"Well, now that you mention it, I suppose it isn't all that pleasant.... Not that it's
particularly unpleasant, you understand. So I guess I don't really mind. You want to call
me Otsuka, be my guest. I'll admit, though, that it doesn't sound right when you call me
that."
"Nakata's very happy to hear you say that. Thank you so much, Mr. Otsuka."
"I must say that for a human you have an odd way of talking," Otsuka commented.
"Yes, everybody tells me that. But this is the only way Nakata can speak. I try to
talk normally but this is what happens. Nakata's not very bright, you see. I wasn't always
this way, but when I was little I was in an accident and I've been dumb ever since.
Nakata can't write. Or read a book or a newspaper."
"Not to boast or anything, but I can't write either," the cat said, licking the pads of
his right paw. "I'd say my mind is average, though, so I've never found it inconvenient."
"In the cat world that's to be expected," Nakata said. "But in the human world if
you can't read or write you're considered dumb. Nakata's father--he passed away a long
time ago--was a famous professor in a university. His specialty was something called
theery of fine ants. I have two younger brothers, and they're both very bright. One of
them works at a company, and he's a depart mint chief. My other brother works at a
place called the minis tree of trade and indus tree. They both live in huge houses and eat
eel. Nakata's the only one who isn't bright."
"But you're able to talk with cats."
"That's correct," Nakata said.
"Then you're not so dumb after all."
"Yes. No... I mean, Nakata doesn't really know about that, but ever since I was
little people said You're dumb, you're dumb, so I suppose I must be. I can't read the
names of stations so I can't buy a ticket and take a train. If I show my handycap pass,
though, they let me ride the city bus."
"Interesting...," Otsuka said without much interest.
"If you can't read or write you can't find a job."
"Then how do you make a living?"
"I get a sub city."
"Sub city?"
"The Governor gives me money. I live in a little room in an apartment in Nogata
called the Shoeiso. And I eat three meals a day."
"Sounds like a pretty good life. To me, at least."
"You're right. It is a pretty good life. Nakata can keep out of the wind and rain,
and I have everything I need. And sometimes, like now, people ask me to help them find
cats. They give me a present when I do. But I've got to keep this a secret from the
Governor, so don't tell anybody. They might cut down my sub city if they find out I
have some extra money coming in. It's never a lot, but thanks to it I can eat eel every
once in a while. Nakata loves eel."
"I like eel too. Though I only had it once, a long time ago, and can't really recall
what it tastes like."
"Eel is quite a treat. There's something different about it, compared to other food.
Certain foods can take the place of others, but as far as I know, nothing can take the
place of eel."
On the road in front of the empty lot a young man walked by with a large
Labrador retriever with a red bandanna tied around its neck. It glanced over at Otsuka
but walked on by. The old man and the cat sat there in the lot, silently waiting for the
dog and his master to disappear.
"You said you look for cats?" Otsuka asked.
"That's correct. I search for lost cats. I can speak with cats a little, so I go all over
tracking down ones that have gone missing. People hear that Nakata's good at this, so
they come and ask me to look for their lost cats. These days I spend more days than not
out searching for cats. I don't like to go too far away, so I just look for them inside
Nakano Ward. Otherwise I'll be the one lost and they'll be out looking for me."
"So right now you're searching for a lost cat?"
"Yes, that's correct. Nakata's looking for a one-year-old tortoiseshell cat named
Goma. Here's a photo of her." Nakata pulled a color copy out of his canvas shoulder bag
and showed it to Otsuka. "She's wearing a brown flea collar."
Otsuka stretched out to gaze at the photograph, then shook his head.
"No, 'fraid I've never run across this one. I know most of the cats around here, but
this one I don't know. Never seen, or heard, anything about her."
"Is that right?"
"Have you been looking for her for a long time?"
"Well, today is, let me see... one, two, three... the third day."
Otsuka sat there thinking for a time. "I assume you're aware of this, but cats are
creatures of habit. Usually they live very ordered lives, and unless something
extraordinary happens they generally try to keep to their routine. What might disrupt this
is either sex or an accident--one of the two."
"Nakata's thinking the same thing."
"If it's sex, then you just have to wait till they get it out of their system and they'll
be back. You do understand what I mean by sex?"
"I haven't done it myself, but I think I understand. It has to do with your weenie,
right?"
"That's right. It's all about the weenie." Otsuka nodded, a serious look on his face.
"But if we're talking about an accident, you might never see her again."
"That's true."
"Also, sometimes when a cat's on the prowl for sex it might wander off and have
trouble finding its way back home again."
"If Nakata went out of Nakano Ward, finding my way home wouldn't be easy."
"That's happened to me a few times. Course that was a long time ago, when I was
much younger," Otsuka said, eyes narrowed as he searched his memory. "Once you're
lost, you panic. You're in total despair, not knowing what to do. I hate it when that
happens. Sex can be a real pain that way, course when you get in the mood all you can
think about is what's right under your nose--that's sex, all right. So that cat--what was
her name? The one that's lost?"
"Do you mean Goma?"
"Yes, of course. Goma. I'd like to do what I can to help you find her. A young
tortoiseshell cat like that, with some nice family taking care of her, wouldn't know the
first thing about making her way in the world. Wouldn't be able to fight off anybody or
fend for herself, the poor thing. Unfortunately, however, I've never seen her. I think you
might want to search somewhere else."
"Well, then, I suppose I should follow your advice and go to some other place to
look. Nakata's very sorry to have interrupted your nap. I'm sure I'll stop by here again
sometime, so if you spot Goma in the meantime, please let me know. I'd like to give you
something for your help."
"No need--I enjoyed talking with you. Feel free to drop by again. On sunny days
this is where you'll mostly find me. When it rains I'm generally in that shrine over there
where the steps go down."
"Well, thank you very much. Nakata was very happy, too, to be able to talk with
you, Mr. Otsuka. I can't always speak so easily to every cat I meet. Sometimes when I
try the cat is on his guard and runs away without saying a word. When all I ever said
was hello."
"I can well imagine. There're all sorts of cats--just like there're all sorts of
people."
"That's exactly right. Nakata feels the same way. There are all kinds of people in
the world, and all kinds of cats."
Otsuka stretched and looked up at the sky. Golden sunlight filled the vacant lot
but the air held a hint of rain, something Otsuka was able to sense. "Didn't you say that
when you were little you had an accident, and that's why you're not so smart?"
"Yes, that's right. That's exactly what Nakata said. I had an accident when I was
nine years old."
"What sort of accident?"
"Nakata can't really remember. They don't know why, but I had a high fever for
about three weeks. I was unconscious the whole time. I was asleep in a bed in a hospital,
they told me, with an intra venus in me. And when I finally woke up, I couldn't
remember a thing. I'd forgotten my father's face, my mother's face, how to read, how to
add, what my house looked like inside. Even my own name. My head was completely
empty, like a bathtub after you pull the plug. They tell me before the accident Nakata
always got good grades. But once I collapsed and woke up I was dumb. My mother died
a long time ago, but she used to cry about this a lot. Because I got stupid. My father
never cried, but he was always angry."
"Instead of being smart, though, you found yourself able to talk with cats."
"That's correct."
"Interesting...."
"Besides that, I'm always healthy and haven't been sick once. I don't have any
cavities, and don't have to wear glasses."
"As far as I can tell, you seem fairly intelligent."
"Is that so?" Nakata said, inclining his head. "Nakata's well past sixty now, Mr.
Otsuka. Once I got past sixty I was quite used to being dumb, and people not having
anything to do with me. You can survive without riding trains. Father's dead, so nobody
hits me anymore. Mother's dead too, so she doesn't cry. So actually, if you say I'm pretty
smart, it's a bit upsetting. You see, if I'm not dumb then the Governor won't give me a
sub city anymore, and no more special bus pass. If the Governor says, You're not dumb
after all, then Nakata doesn't know what to say. So this is fine, being dumb."
"What I'm trying to say is your problem isn't that you're dumb," Otsuka said, an
earnest look on his face.
"Really?"
"Your problem is that your shadow is a bit--how should I put it? Faint. I thought
this the first time I laid eyes on you, that the shadow you cast on the ground is only half
as dark as that of ordinary people."
"I see...."
"I ran across another person like that once."
Mouth slightly ajar, Nakata stared at Otsuka. "You mean you saw somebody like
Nakata?"
"Yes, I did. That's why I wasn't so surprised that you could talk to cats."
"When was that?"
"A long time ago, when I was still a youngster. But I can't remember the details--
the person's face or name or where and when we met. As I said before, cats don't have
that sort of memory."
"I see."
"That person's shadow, too, looked like half of it had gotten separated from him.
It was as faint as yours."
"I see."
"What I think is this: You should give up looking for lost cats and start searching
for the other half of your shadow."
Nakata tugged a few times at the bill of his hat in his hands. "To tell the truth,
Nakata's had that feeling before. That my shadow is weak. Other people might not
notice, but I do."
"That's good, then," the cat said.
"But I'm already old, and may not live much longer. Mother's already dead.
Father's already dead. Whether you're smart or dumb, can read or can't, whether you've
got a shadow or not, once the time comes, everybody passes on. You die and they
cremate you. You turn into ashes and they bury you at a place called Karasuyama.
Karasuyama's in Setagaya Ward. Once they bury you there, though, you probably can't
think about anything anymore. And if you can't think, then you can't get confused. So
isn't the way I am now just fine? What I can do, while I'm alive, is never go out of
Nakano Ward. But when I die, I'll have to go to Karasuyama. That can't be helped."
"What you think about it is entirely up to you, of course," Otsuka said, and again
began licking the pads of his paw. "Though you should consider how your shadow feels
about it. It might have a bit of an inferiority complex--as a shadow, that is. If I were a
shadow, I know I wouldn't like to be half of what I should be."
"I understand," Nakata said. "You may well be right. Nakata's never thought
about it. I'll think about it more after I get home."
"An excellent idea."
The two of them were silent for a while. Nakata quietly stood up, carefully
brushing away stray bits of grass from his trousers, and put on his threadbare hat. He
adjusted it a few times, until he got the angle just right. He shouldered his canvas bag
and said, "Thank you very kindly. Nakata really values your opinions, Mr. Otsuka. I
hope you stay happy and well."
"You too."
After Nakata left, Otsuka lay down again in the grass and closed his eyes. There
was still some time before the clouds would come and the rain would start. His mind a
blank, he fell asleep for a short nap.
Chapter 7
At seven-fifteen I eat breakfast in the restaurant next to the lobby--toast, hot milk, ham
and eggs. But this free hotel breakfast doesn't come close to filling me up. The food's all
gone before I realize it, and I'm still hungry. I look around, and seconds on toast don't
seem likely to materialize. I let out a big sigh.
"Well, what are you gonna do?" the boy named Crow says.
He's sitting right across from me.
"You're not back home anymore, where you can stuff yourself with whatever you
like," he says. "I mean, you've run away from home, right? Get that through your head.
You're used to getting up early and eating a huge breakfast, but those days are long gone,
my friend. You'll have to scrape by on what they give you. You know what they say
about how the size of your stomach can adjust to the amount of food you eat? Well,
you're about to see if that's really true. Your stomach's gonna get smaller, though that'll
take some time. Think you can handle it?"
"Yeah, I can handle it," I reply.
"Good," Crow tells me. "You're supposed to be the toughest fifteen-year-old on
the planet, remember?"
I give him a nod.
"Well, then, how about you stop staring at your empty plate and get a move on?"
Following this advice, I stand up and go to the front desk to negotiate over the
price of my room. I explain I'm a student at a private high school in Tokyo and have
come here to write my graduation paper. (Which isn't a total lie, since the high school
affiliated with my school has this kind of setup.) I add that I'm collecting materials for
the paper at the Komura Memorial Library. There's much more to research than I'd
imagined, so I'll have to stay at least a week in Takamatsu. But since I'm on a budget,
would the discounted room rate be possible not just for three days, but for the whole
time I'm here? I offer to pay each day in advance, and promise not to cause any trouble.
I stand there in front of the girl in charge, trying to do my best imitation of a nice,
well-brought-up young man who's in a tight spot. No dyed hair for me, no piercings. I
have on a clean white Ralph Lauren polo shirt, chinos, and a pair of brand-new
Topsiders. My teeth are gleaming and I smell like soap and shampoo. I know how to
speak politely. When I feel like it, I'm pretty good at impressing people older than me.
The girl listens silently, nodding, her lips slightly twisted up. She's petite, and
wearing a green uniform blazer over a white blouse. She looks a little sleepy, but goes
about her morning duties briskly. She's about the same age as my sister.
"I understand," she says, "but I have to clear it with the manager. We should have
an answer for you by noon." Her tone is businesslike, but I can tell that in her book, I
pass. She notes down my name and room number. I have no idea whether this
negotiating will get me anywhere. It might blow up in my face--if the manager demands
to see my student ID, say, or tries to get in touch with my parents. (Of course I gave a
phony home phone number when I registered.) But seeing as how my funds are limited,
I figure it's worth the risk.
I check the Yellow Pages and call a public gym and ask about their weight
machines. They have most of what I need, and it only costs five bucks a day. I get
directions from the station, thank them, and hang up.
I go back to my room for my backpack, then hit the streets. I could just leave my
stuff in the room, or in the hotel safe, but I feel better carrying it all with me. It's like it's
a part of me already, and I can't let go.
On the bus from the terminal in front of the station to the gym, I can feel my face
tighten up, I'm so nervous. Suppose somebody asks why a kid my age is traipsing off to
the gym in the middle of the day? I don't know this town and have no idea what these
people are thinking. But no one gives me a second glance. I'm starting to feel like the
Invisible Man or something. I pay the entrance fee at the desk, no questions asked, and
get a key to a locker. After changing into shorts and a T-shirt in the locker room, I do
some stretching exercises. As my muscles relax, so do I. I'm safe inside this container
called me. With a little click, the outlines of this being--me--fit right inside and are
locked neatly away. Just the way I like it. I'm where I belong.
I start on my circuit training. With Prince blasting away on my Walkman, I put in
a good hour of training, making my usual round of the seven machines. I thought for
sure a gym in such a small town would be full of dated machines, but these are the latest
models, with the metallic smell of brand-new steel. The first round I do with light
weights, then increase the weight for the second circuit. I know exactly how much
weight and how many reps work for me. Pretty soon I start to sweat and stop every once
in a while to take a swig from the bottle and a bite out of a lemon I bought on the way
over.
Once I finish training I take a hot shower using the soap and shampoo I've
brought along. I do a good job of washing my cock, not too many years out of its
foreskin, and under my arms, balls, and butt. I weigh myself and flex my muscles a bit
in front of a mirror. Finally I rinse out my sweaty shorts and T-shirt in the sink, wring
them out, and stow them away in a plastic bag.
I take a bus back to the station and have a steaming bowl of udon in the same
diner as the day before. I take my time, gazing out the window as I eat. The station's
packed with people streaming in and out, all of them dressed in their favorite clothes,
bags or briefcases in hand, each one dashing off to take care of some pressing business. I
stare at this ceaseless, rushing crowd and imagine a time a hundred years from now. In a
hundred years everybody here--me included--will have disappeared from the face of the
earth and turned into ashes or dust. A weird thought, but everything in front of me starts
to seem unreal, like a gust of wind could blow it all away.
I spread my hands out in front of me and take a good hard look at them. What am
I always so tense about? Why this desperate struggle just to survive? I shake my head,
turn from the window, clear my mind of thoughts of a hundred years away. I'll just think
about now. About books waiting to be read in the library, machines in the gym I haven't
worked out on. Thinking about anything else isn't going to get me anywhere.
"That's the ticket," Crow tells me. "Remember, you're supposed to be the toughest
fifteen-year-old on the planet."
Like the day before, I buy a box lunch at the station and take the train, arriving at
the Komura Library at eleven-thirty. And sure enough, Oshima's there at the counter.
Today he's wearing a blue rayon shirt buttoned to the neck, white jeans, and white tennis
shoes. He's sitting at his desk, absorbed in some massive book, with the same yellow
pencil, I guess, lying beside him. His bangs are all over his face. When I come in he
looks up, smiles, and takes my backpack from me.
"Still not going back to school, I see."
"I'm never going back," I confess.
"A library's a pretty good alternative, then," he says. He turns around to check the
time on the clock behind him, then goes back to his reading.
I head off to the reading room and back to Arabian Nights. Like always, once I
settle down and start flipping pages, I can't stop. The Burton edition has all the stories I
remember reading as a child, but they're longer, with more episodes and plot twists, and
so much more absorbing that it's hard to believe they're the same. They're full of
obscene, violent, sexual, basically outrageous scenes. Like the genie in the bottle they
have this sort of vital, living sense of play, of freedom, that common sense can't keep
bottled up. I love it and can't let go. Compared to those faceless hordes of people rushing
through the train station, these crazy, preposterous stories of a thousand years ago are, at
least to me, much more real. How that's possible, I don't know. It's pretty weird.
At one o'clock I go out to the garden again, sit on the porch, and eat my lunch. I'm
about halfway done when Oshima comes over and says I have a phone call.
"A phone call?" I say, at a loss for words. "For me?"
"As long as your name's Kafka Tamura."
I blush, get to my feet, and take the cordless phone from him.
It's the girl at the front desk at the hotel, most likely checking to see if I'm really
doing research at the library. She sounds relieved to find out I hadn't lied to her. "I
talked with the manager," she says, "and he said they've never done this before, but
seeing as how you're young and there are special circumstances, he'll make an exception
and let you stay at the rate the YMCA arranged for you. We're not so busy right now, he
said, so we can bend the rules a bit. He also said that library's supposed to be really nice,
so he hopes you'll be able to take your time and do as much research as you need to."
I breathe a sigh of relief and thank her. I feel a little bad about lying, but there's
not much I can do about it. I've got to bend some rules myself if I want to survive. I
hang up and hand the phone back to Oshima.
"You're the only high school student who comes here, so I figured it must be for
you," he says. "I told her you're here from morning till night, your nose stuck in a book.
Which is true."
"Thanks," I tell him.
"Kafka Tamura?"
"That's my name."
"Kind of strange."
"Well, that's my name," I insist.
"I assume you've read some of Kafka's stories?"
I nod. "The Castle, and The Trial, 'The Metamorphosis,' plus that weird story
about an execution device."
"'In the Penal Colony,'" Oshima says. "I love that story. Only Kafka could have
written that."
"That's my favorite of his short stories."
"No kidding?"
I nod.
"Why's that?"
It takes me a while to gather my thoughts. "I think what Kafka does is give a
purely mechanical explanation of that complex machine in the story, as sort of a
substitute for explaining the situation we're in. What I mean is..." I have to give it some
more thought. "What I mean is, that's his own device for explaining the kind of lives we
lead. Not by talking about our situation, but by talking about the details of the machine."
"That makes sense," Oshima says and lays a hand on my shoulder, the gesture
natural, and friendly. "I imagine Franz Kafka would agree with you."
He takes the cordless phone and disappears back into the building. I stay on the
veranda for a while, finishing my lunch, drinking my mineral water, watching the birds
in the garden. For all I know they're the same birds from yesterday. The sky's covered
with clouds, not a speck of blue in sight.
Oshima most likely found my explanation of the Kafka story convincing. To
some extent at least. But what I really wanted to say didn't get across. I wasn't just
giving some general theory of Kafka's fiction, I was talking about something very real.
Kafka's complex, mysterious execution device wasn't some metaphor or allegory--it's
actually here, all around me. But I don't think anybody would get that. Not Oshima. Not
anybody.
I go back to the reading room, where I sink down in the sofa and into the world of
The Arabian Nights. Slowly, like a movie fadeout, the real world evaporates. I'm alone,
inside the world of the story. My favorite feeling in the world.
When at five I'm about to leave Oshima's still behind the counter, reading the
same book, his shirt still without a single wrinkle. Like always, a couple strands of hair
have fallen across his face. The hands of the electric clock on the wall behind him
soundlessly tick forward. Everything around him is silent and clean. I doubt the guy ever
sweats or hiccups. He looks up and hands me my backpack. He frowns a bit, like it's too
heavy for him. "Do you take the train here from town?"
I nod.
"If you're going to come every day, you should have this." He hands me a sheet of
paper, the train schedule, it turns out, between Takamatsu Station and the station where I
get off for the library. "They usually run on time."
"Thanks," I say, slipping the sheet in my backpack.
"Kafka--I don't have any idea where you came from, or what your plans are, but
you can't stay in a hotel forever, right?" he says, choosing his words carefully. With the
fingers of his left hand he checks the tips of his pencils. Not that it's necessary, since
they're all as sharp as can be.
I don't say anything.
"I'm not trying to butt in, believe me. I just thought I might as well ask. A boy
your age in a place you've never been before--I can't imagine it's easy going."
I nod again.
"Are you headed someplace else after here? Or are you going to be here for a
while?"
"I haven't decided yet, but I think I'll be here for a while. No other place to go," I
admit.
Maybe I should tell Oshima everything. I'm pretty sure he won't put me down,
give me a lecture, or try to force some common sense on me. But right now I'm trying to
keep my words to a minimum. Plus I'm not exactly used to telling people how I feel.
"For the time being, then, you think you can manage?" Oshima asks.
I give a short nod.
"Good luck, then," he says.
Except for a few minor details, I spend the next seven days in the same way.
(Except for Monday, of course, when the library's closed, and I spend the day at a big
public library.) The alarm clock gets me up at six-thirty every morning, and I gulp down
the hotel's pseudo-breakfast. If the chestnut-haired girl's behind the front desk, I give her
a little wave. She always nods and repays me with a smile. I think she likes me, and I
kind of like her, too. Could she be my sister? The thought does cross my mind.
Every morning I do some easy stretching exercises in my room, and when the
time rolls around I go to the gym and run through the usual circuit training. Always the
same amount of weight, the same number of reps. No more, no less. I take a shower and
wash every inch of me. I weigh myself, to make sure my weight's staying steady. Before
noon I take the train to the Komura Library. Exchange a few words with Oshima when I
give him my backpack, and when I pick it up. Eat lunch out on the veranda. And read.
When I finish The Arabian Nights I tackle the complete works of Natsume Soseki--
there're still a couple of his novels I haven't read yet. At five I exit the library. So most
of the day I'm in the gym or the library. As long as I'm in one of those two, nobody
seems to worry about me. Chances are pretty slim a kid skipping school would hang out
in either one. I eat dinner at the diner in front of the station. I try to eat as many
vegetables as I can, and occasionally buy fruit from a stand and peel it using the knife I
took from my father's desk. I buy cucumbers and celery, wash them in the sink at the
hotel, and eat them with mayonnaise. Sometimes I pick up a container of milk from the
mini-mart and have a bowl of cereal.
Back in my room I jot down what I did that day in my diary, listen to Radiohead
on my Walkman, read a little, and then it's lights out at eleven. Sometimes I masturbate
before going to sleep. I think about the girl at the front desk, putting any thoughts of her
potentially being my sister out of my head, for the time being. I hardly watch any TV or
read any newspapers.
But on the evening of the eighth day--as had to happen sooner or later--this
simple, centripetal life is blown to bits.
Chapter 8
U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE SECTION (MIS) REPORT Dated: May 12, 1946 Title:
Report on the Rice Bowl Hill Incident, 1944 Document Number: PTYX-722-8936745-
42216-WWN T he following is a taped interview with Doctor Shigenori Tsukayama
(52), professor in the Department of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine, Tokyo
Imperial University, which took place over a three-hour span at the GHQ of the
Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. Documentation related to the interview can
be accessed using application number PTYX-722-SQ-267 to 291. [Note: Documents
271 and 278 are missing.]
Impressions of the interviewer, Lt. Robert O'Connor: Professor Tsukayama was
quite calm and relaxed throughout the interview, as one might expect of an expert of his
caliber. He is one of the leading psychiatrists in Japan and has published a number of
outstanding books on the subject. Unlike most Japanese, he avoids vague statements,
drawing a sharp distinction between facts and conjecture. Before the war he was an
exchange scholar at Stanford, and is quite fluent in English. He is surely well liked and
respected by many.
We were ordered by the military to immediately undertake an examination of the
children in question. It was the middle of November 1944. It was quite unusual for us to
receive requests or orders from the military. The military, of course, had its own
extensive medical branch, and being a self-contained entity that put a high priority on
secrecy, they usually preferred to handle matters internally. Apart from the rare times
when they needed the special knowledge and techniques that only outside researchers or
physicians had, they seldom appealed to civilian doctors or researchers.
Thus when they broached this we immediately surmised that something
extraordinary had occurred. Frankly, I didn't like to work under military directions. In
most cases their goals were strictly utilitarian, with no interest in pursuing truth in an
academic sense, only arriving at conclusions that accorded with their preconceptions.
They weren't the type of people swayed by logic. But it was wartime and we couldn't
very well say no. We had to keep quiet and do exactly as we were told.
We'd been continuing our research despite the American air raids. Most of our
undergrads and grad students, though, had been drafted. Students in psychiatry weren't
exempt for the draft, unfortunately. When the order came from the military we dropped
everything and took a train to [name deleted] in Yamanashi Prefecture. There were three
of us--myself and a colleague from the Psychiatry Department, as well as a research
physician from the Department of Neurosurgery with whom we'd been conducting
research.
As soon as we got there they warned us that what they were about to reveal was a
military secret we could never divulge. Then they told us about the incident that had
occurred at the beginning of the month. How sixteen schoolchildren had lost
consciousness in the hills and fifteen of them had regained consciousness thereafter,
with no memory of what had taken place. One boy, they told us, hadn't regained
consciousness and was still in a military hospital in Tokyo.
The military doctor who'd examined the children right after the incident, an
internal medicine specialist named Major Toyama, gave us a detailed explanation about
what had transpired. Many army doctors are more like bureaucrats concerned with
protecting their own little preserve than with medicine, but fortunately Major Toyama
wasn't one of them. He was honest and straightforward, and obviously a talented
physician. He never tried to use the fact that we were civilians to lord it over us or
conceal anything from us, as some might do. He provided all the details we needed, in a
very professional manner, and showed us medical records that had been kept on the
children. He wanted to get to the bottom of this as much as anybody. We were all quite
impressed by him.
The most important fact we gleaned from the records was that, medically
speaking, the incident had caused no lasting impact on the children. From right after the
event to the present day, the examinations and tests consistently indicated no internal or
external abnormalities. The children were leading healthy lives, just as they had before
the incident. Detailed examinations revealed that several of the children had parasites,
but nothing out of the ordinary. Otherwise they were completely asymptomatic--no
headaches, nausea, pain, loss of appetite, insomnia, listlessness, diarrhea, nightmares.
Nothing.
The one notable thing was that the two-hour span during which the children had
been unconscious in the hills was erased from their memory. As if that part had been
extracted in toto. Rather than a memory loss, it was more a memory lack. These aren't
medical terms, and I'm using them for the sake of convenience, but there's a big
difference between loss and lack. I suppose it's like--well, imagine a train steaming
down a track. The freight's disappeared from one of the cars. A car that's empty inside--
that's loss. When the whole car itself has vanished, that's lack.
We discussed the possibility that the children had breathed in poison gas. Dr.
Toyama said that naturally they'd considered this. That's why the military is involved, he
told us, but it seems a remote possibility. He then told us, Now this is a military secret,
so you can't tell anyone. The army is definitely developing poison gas and biological
weapons, but this is carried out mainly by a special unit on the Chinese mainland, not in
Japan itself. It's too dangerous a project to attempt in a place as densely populated as
Japan. I can't tell you whether or not these sorts of weapons are stored anywhere in
Japan, though I can assure you most definitely that they are not kept anywhere in
Yamanashi Prefecture.
--So he categorically denied that special weapons, including poison gas, were
being stored in the prefecture?
Correct. He was very clear about that. We basically had no choice except to
believe him, but he sounded believable. We also concluded that it was highly unlikely
that poison gas had been dropped from a B-29. If the Americans had actually developed
such a weapon and decided to use it, they'd drop it on some large city where the effects
would be massive. Dropping a canister or two on such a remote place wouldn't allow
them to ascertain what effects the weapon had. Besides, even if you accepted the
premise that a poison gas had been dropped on the spot, any gas that makes children fall
unconscious for two hours with no other lasting effects would be worthless as military
arsenal.
Also we knew that no poison gas, whether manmade or naturally occurring,
would act like this, leaving no aftereffects whatsoever. Especially when you're dealing
with children, who are more sensitive and have a more delicate immune system than
adults, there would have to be some aftereffects, particularly in the eyes or mucous
membranes. We crossed off food poisoning for the same reason.
So what we were left with were psychological problems, or problems dealing
with brain function. In a case like that, standard medical methodology wouldn't help at
all in isolating the cause. The effects would be invisible, something you couldn't
quantify. We finally understood why we had been called here by the military to consult.
We interviewed every child involved in the incident, as well as the homeroom
teacher and attending physician. Major Toyama also participated. But these interviews
yielded almost nothing new--we merely confirmed what the major had already told us.
The children had no memory whatsoever of the event. They saw what looked like a
plane glinting high up in the sky, climbed up Owan yama, and began hunting
mushrooms. Then there's a gap in time and the next thing they recall is lying on the
ground, surrounded by a group of worried-looking teachers and policemen. They felt
fine, without any pain, discomfort, or nausea. Their minds just felt a bit blank, as you do
when you first wake up in the morning. That was all. Each child gave the same exact
response.
After conducting these interviews we concluded that this was a case of mass
hypnosis. From the symptoms the homeroom teacher and school doctor observed at the
scene, this hypothesis made the most sense. The regular movement of the eyes, the
slight lowering of respiration, heartbeat, and temperature, the lack of memory--it all fit.
The teacher alone didn't lose consciousness because for whatever reason what produced
this mass hypnosis didn't affect adults.
We weren't able to pinpoint the cause, however. Generally speaking, though,
mass hypnotism requires two elements. First, the group must be close-knit and
homogeneous, and placed in restricted circumstances. Secondly, something has to
trigger the reaction, something that acts simultaneously on everyone. In this case it
might have been the glint of that airplane they saw. This is just a hypothesis, mind you--
we weren't able to find any other candidates--and there may very well have been some
other trigger that set it off. I broached the idea of it being a case of mass hypnosis with
Major Toyama, making it clear this was merely a conjecture. My two colleagues
generally concurred. Coincidentally, this also happened to be indirectly related to a
research topic we were investigating ourselves.
"That does seem to fit the evidence," Major Toyama said after giving it some
thought. "This is not my field, but it would appear to be the likeliest explanation. But
there's one thing I don't understand--what made them snap out of this mass hypnosis?
There'd have to be some sort of reverse triggering mechanism."
I really don't know, I admitted. All I could do was speculate. My hypothesis was
this: There is a system in place which, after a certain amount of time passes,
automatically breaks the spell. Our bodies have strong defense mechanisms in place, and
if an outside system takes over momentarily, once a certain amount of time has passed
it's like an alarm bell goes off, activating an emergency system that deprograms this
foreign object that blocks our built-in defenses--in this case the effects of mass
hypnosis--and eliminates it.
Unfortunately, I don't have the materials in front of me, so I can't quote the exact
figures, but as I told Major Toyama, there have been reports of similar incidents
occurring abroad. All of them are considered mysteries with no logical explanation. A
large number of children lose consciousness at the same time, and several hours later
wake up without any memory of what happened.
This incident is quite unusual, in other words, but not without precedent. One
strange instance took place around 1930, in the outskirts of a small village in
Devonshire, England. For no apparent reason, a group of thirty junior high students
walking down a country path fell to the ground, one after the other, and lost
consciousness. Several hours later, as if nothing had happened, they regained
consciousness and walked back to school under their own steam. A physician examined
them right away but could find nothing medically wrong. Not one of them could recall
what had taken place.
At the end of the last century, a similar incident occurred in Australia. Outside of
Adelaide fifteen teenage girls from a private girls school were on an outing when all of
them lost consciousness, and then regained it. Again there were no injuries, no
aftereffects. It ended up classified as a case of heatstroke, but all of them had lost
consciousness and recovered it at nearly the same time, and nobody showed symptoms
of heatstroke, so the real cause remains a mystery. Besides, it wasn't a particularly hot
day when it occurred. Probably there was no other accounting for what had taken place,
so they decided this was the best explanation.
These cases share several things in common: they took place among a group of
either young boys or girls, somewhat distant from their school, all of whom lost
consciousness essentially simultaneously and then regained it about the same time, with
no one displaying any aftereffects. It's reported that some of the adults who happened to
be with the children also lost consciousness, and some did not. Each case was different
in that regard.
There are other similar incidents, but these two are the best documented, and thus
are representative cases in the literature of this phenomenon. This recent instance in
Yamanashi Prefecture, however, contains one element that differentiates it from the rest:
namely that one boy did not regain consciousness. This child is the key to unlocking the
truth to this whole event. We returned to Tokyo after our interviews in Yamanashi and
went straight to the army hospital where the boy was being cared for.
--The army, then, was only interested in this incident because they suspected it
may have been caused by poison gas?
That's my understanding. But Major Toyama would know more about this, and I
suggest you ask him directly.
--Major Toyama was killed in Tokyo in March 1945, in the line of duty, during
an air raid.
I'm very sorry to hear that. We lost so many promising people in the war.
--Eventually, though, the army concluded that this was not caused by any
chemical weapons. They couldn't determine the cause, but they decided, didn't they, that
it was unrelated to the war?
Yes, I believe that's true. At this point they'd concluded their investigation into
the matter. But the boy, Nakata, was allowed to remain in the military hospital, since
Major Toyama was personally interested in the case and had some connections there.
Thus we were able to go to the military hospital every day, and take turns staying
overnight to investigate this unconscious boy's case further, from a number of angles.
Though unconscious, the boy's bodily functions nevertheless continued normally.
He was given nutrients intravenously and discharged urine at regular intervals. He shut
his eyes at night and went to sleep when we turned out the lights, then opened them
again in the morning. Other than being unconscious, he appeared completely healthy.
He was in a coma, but didn't dream, apparently. When people dream they exhibit
characteristic eye movements and facial expressions. Your heart rate goes up as you
react to experiences in your dreams. But with the Nakata boy we couldn't detect any of
these indicators. His heart rate, breathing, and temperature were still slightly on the low
side, but surprisingly stable.
It might sound strange to put it this way, but it seemed like the real Nakata had
gone off somewhere, leaving behind for a time the fleshly container, which in his
absence kept all his bodily functions going at the minimum level needed to preserve
itself. The term "spirit projection" sprang to mind. Are you familiar with it? Japanese
folk tales are full of this sort of thing, where the soul temporarily leaves the body and
goes off a great distance to take care of some vital task and then returns to reunite with
the body. The sort of vengeful spirits that populate The Tale of Genji may be something
similar. The notion of the soul not just leaving the body at death but--assuming the will
is strong enough--also being able to separate from the body of the living is probably an
idea that took root in Japan in ancient times. Of course there's no scientific proof of this,
and I hesitate to even raise the idea.
The practical problem that faced us was how to wake this boy from his coma, and
restore him to consciousness. Struggling to find a reverse trigger to undo the hypnosis,
we tried everything. We brought his parents there, had them shout out his name. We
tried that for several days, but there was no reaction. We tried every trick in the book as
far as hypnosis goes--clapping our hands in different ways right in front of his face. We
played music he knew, read his schoolbooks aloud to him, let him catch a whiff of his
favorite foods. We even brought in his cat from home, one he was particularly fond of.
We used every method we could think of to bring him back to reality, but nothing
worked.
About two weeks into this, when we'd run out of ideas and were exhausted and
discouraged, the boy woke up on his own. Not because of anything we'd done. Without
warning, as if the time for this had been decided in advance, he came to.
--Did anything out of the ordinary take place that day?
Nothing worth mentioning. It was a day like any other. At ten a. m. the nurse
came to draw a blood sample. Right after that he choked a bit, and some of the blood
spilled on the sheets. Not much, and they changed the sheets right away. That was about
the only thing different that day. The boy woke up about a half hour after that. Out of
the blue he sat up in bed, stretched, and looked around the room. He had regained
consciousness, and medically he was perfectly fine. Soon, though, we realized he'd lost
his entire memory. He couldn't even remember his own name. The place he lived in, his
school, his parents' faces--it was all gone. He couldn't read, and wasn't even aware this
was Japan or the Earth. He couldn't even fathom the concept of Japan or the Earth. He'd
returned to this world with his mind wiped clean. The proverbial blank slate.
Chapter 9
When I come to I'm in thick brush, lying there on the damp ground like some log. I can't
see a thing, it's so dark.
My head propped up by prickly brambles, I take a deep breath and smell plants,
and dirt, and, mixed in, a faint whiff of dog crap. I can see the night sky through the tree
branches. There's no moon or stars, but the sky is strangely bright. The clouds act as a
screen, reflecting all the light from below. An ambulance wails off in the distance,
grows closer, then fades away. By listening closely, I can barely catch the rumble of
tires from traffic. I figure I must be in some corner of the city.
I try to pull myself together and pick up the scattered jigsaw puzzle pieces of me
lying all around. This is a first, I think. Or is it? I had this feeling somewhere before. But
when? I search my memory, but that fragile thread snaps. I close my eyes and let time
pass by.
With a jolt of panic I remember my backpack. Where could I have left it? No way
can I lose it--everything I own's inside. But how am I going to find it in the dark? I try to
get to my feet, but my fingers have lost all their strength.
I struggle to raise my left hand--why is it so heavy all of a sudden?--and bring my
watch close to my face, fixing my eyes on it. The digital numbers read 11:26. May 28. I
think of my diary. May 28... good--so I haven't lost a day. I haven't been lying here, out
cold, for days. At most my consciousness and I parted company for a few hours. Maybe
four hours, I figure.
May 28... a day like any other, the same exact routine. Nothing out of the
ordinary. I went to the gym, then to the Komura Library. Did my usual workout on the
machines, read Soseki on the same sofa. Had dinner near the station. The fish dinner, as
I recall. Salmon, with a second helping of rice, some miso soup, and salad. After that...
after that I don't know what happened.
My left shoulder aches a little. As my senses return, so does the pain. I must have
bumped into something pretty hard. I rub that part with my right hand. There's no wound,
or swelling. Did I get hit by a car, maybe? But my clothes aren't ripped, and the only
place that hurts is that spot in my left shoulder. Probably just a bruise.
I fumble around in the bushes, but all I touch are branches, hard and twisted like
the hearts of bullied little animals. No backpack. I go through my pant pockets. My
wallet's there, thank God. Some cash is in it, the hotel key card, a phone card. Besides
this I've got a coin purse, a handkerchief, a ballpoint pen. As far as I can tell in the dark,
nothing's missing. I'm wearing cream-colored chinos, a white V-neck T-shirt under a
long-sleeved dungaree shirt. Plus my navy blue Topsiders. My cap's vanished, my New
York Yankees baseball cap. I know I had it on when I left the hotel, but not now. I must
have dropped it, or left it someplace. No big deal. Those are a dime a dozen.
Finally I locate my backpack, leaning up against the trunk of a pine tree. Why in
the world would I leave it there and then scramble into this thicket, only to collapse?
Where the hell am I, anyway? My memory's frozen shut. Anyway, the important thing is
that I found it. I take out my mini flashlight from a side pocket and check out the
contents. Nothing seems to be missing. Thank God the sack with all my cash's there.
I shoulder the backpack and step over bushes, brushing branches out of the way,
until I reach a small clearing. There's a narrow path there, and I follow the beam of my
flashlight into a place where there're some lights. It appears to be the grounds of a
Shinto shrine. I'd lost consciousness in a small woods behind the main shrine building.
A mercury lamp on a high pole illuminates the extensive grounds, casting a kind
of cold light on the inner shrine, the offering box, the votive tablets. My shadow looks
weirdly long on the gravel. I find the shrine's name on the bulletin board and commit it
to memory. Nobody else is around. I see a restroom nearby and go inside and it turns out
to be fairly clean. I take off my backpack and wash my face, then check out my
reflection in the blurry mirror over the sink. I prepare myself for the worst, and I'm not
disappointed--I look like hell. A pale face with sunken cheeks stares back at me, my
neck all muddy, hair sticking out in all directions.
I notice something dark on the front of my white T-shirt, shaped sort of like a
huge butterfly with wings spread. I try brushing it away, but it won't come off. I touch it
and my hands come away all sticky. I need to calm down, so consciously taking my time
I slowly take off both my shirts. Under the flickering fluorescent light I realize what this
is--darkish blood that's seeped into the fabric. The blood's still fresh, wet, and there's lots
of it. I bring it close for a sniff, but there's no smell. Some blood's been spattered on the
dungaree shirt as well, but only a little, and it doesn't stand out on the dark blue material.
The blood on the T-shirt is another story--against the white background there's no
mistaking that.
I wash the T-shirt in the sink. The blood mixes with the water, dyeing the
porcelain sink red, though no matter how hard I scrub the stain won't come out. I'm
about to toss the shirt into the garbage can, then decide against it. If I throw it away,
some other place would be better. I wring out the shirt and stow it in the plastic bag with
my other rinsed-out clothes, and stuff the whole thing into my backpack. I wet my hair
and try to get some of the tangles out. Then I take some soap out of my toilet kit and
wash my hands. They're still trembling a little, but I take my time, carefully washing
between my fingers and under my fingernails. With a damp towel I wipe away the blood
that's seeped onto my bare chest. Then I put on my dungaree shirt, button it up to my
neck, and tuck it into my pants. I don't want people looking at me, so I've got to look at
least halfway normal.
But I'm scared, and my teeth won't stop chattering. Try as I might I can't get them
to stop. I stretch out my hands and look at them. Both are shaking a bit. They look like
somebody else's hands, not my own. Like a pair of little animals with a life all their own.
My palms sting, like I grabbed onto a hot metal bar.
I rest my hands against the sink and lean forward, my head shoved against the
mirror. I feel like crying, but even if I do, nobody's going to come to my rescue.
Nobody...
Man alive, how'd you get all that blood all over you? What the hell were you
doing? But you don't remember a thing, do you. No wounds on you, though, that's a
relief. No real pain, either--except for that throbbing in your left shoulder. So the blood's
gotta be from somebody else, not you. Somebody else's blood.
Anyway, you can't stay here forever. If a patrol car happens to spot you here,
covered with blood, you're up a creek, my friend. Course going back to the hotel might
not be a good idea. You don't know who might be lying in wait, ready to jump you. You
can't be too careful. Looks like you've been involved in some crime, something you
don't remember. Maybe you were the perp. Who knows?
Lucky thing you got all your stuff with you. You were always careful enough to
lug everything you own around in that heavy backpack. Good choice. You did what's
right, so don't worry. Don't be afraid. Everything's going to work out. 'Cause remember-
-you're the toughest fifteen-year-old on the planet, right? Get a hold of yourself! Take
some deep breaths and start using your head. Things'll be fine. But you gotta be very
careful. That's real blood we're talking about--somebody else's blood. And we're not just
talking a drop or two. As we speak I'll bet somebody's trying to track you down.
Better get a move on. There's only one thing to do, one place you gotta go to. And
you know where that is.
I take a couple of deep breaths to calm down, then pick up my pack and get out of
the restroom. I crunch along the gravel, the mercury light beating down on me, and try
to get my brain in gear. Throw the switch, turn the crank, get the old thought process up
and running. But it's no go--not enough juice in the battery to get the engine to turn over.
I need someplace that's safe and warm. That I can escape to for a while and pull myself
together. But where? The only place that comes to mind is the library. But the Komura
Library's shut until tomorrow at eleven, and I need somewhere to lie low till then.
I come up with an alternative. I sit down where nobody can spot me and take the
cell phone from my backpack. I check to see it's still connected, then take Sakura's
phone number from my wallet and punch in the numbers. My fingers still aren't working
well, and it takes a few times before I get the whole number right. I don't get her voice
mail, thank God. Twelve rings later she answers. I tell her my name.
"Kafka Tamura," she repeats, not exactly thrilled. "Do you have any idea how late
it is? I've got to get up early tomorrow."
"I know, I'm sorry to call so late," I tell her. My voice sounds tense. "But I had no
choice. I'm sort of in trouble, and you're the only one I could think of."
No response on the other end. Seems like she's checking my tone of voice,
weighing it in her mind.
"Is it something... serious?" she finally asks.
"I can't tell you right now, but I think so. You've got to help me. Just this once. I
promise I won't be a bother."
She gives it some thought. Not like she's confused or anything, just thinking it
over. "So where are you?"
I tell her the name of the shrine.
"Is that in Takamatsu City?"
"I'm not totally sure, but I think so."
"You don't even know where you are?" she says, dumbfounded.
"It's a long story."
She lets out a sigh. "Grab a cab and come to the Lawson's convenience store on
the corner near my apartment. They have a big sign and you can't miss it." She gives me
the directions. "Do you have money for a cab?"
"I'm good," I say.
"All right," she says and hangs up.
I go out the torii gate at the entrance to the shrine and head for the main road to
flag down a cab. It doesn't take long. I ask the driver if he knows the Lawson's on that
corner, and he says he does. When I ask if it's far, he says no, about a ten-dollar ride.
The cab stops outside the Lawson's and I pay the driver, my hands still unsteady.
I pick up my backpack and go inside the store. I got there so fast Sakura hasn't arrived
yet. I buy a small carton of milk, heat it up in the microwave, and sip it slowly. The
warm milk slips down my throat and calms my stomach a little. When I went inside the
store the clerk glanced at my backpack, keeping an eye out for shoplifters, but after that
nobody pays any attention to me. I stand at the magazine rack, pretending to be picking
one out, and check out my reflection in the window. Though my hair's still a bit of a
mess, you can barely see the blood on my dungaree shirt. If anybody noticed it they'd
think it was just a stain. Now all I have to do is stop trembling.
Ten minutes later Sakura strolls in. It's nearly one a. m. She has on a plain gray
sweatshirt and faded jeans. Her hair's in a ponytail and she's wearing a navy blue New
Balance cap. The moment I spot her, my teeth finally stop chattering. She sidles up
beside me and looks me over carefully, like she's checking out the teeth of some dog
she's about to buy. She lets out a sound halfway between a sigh and actual words, then
lightly pats me twice on the shoulder. "Come on," she says.
Her apartment's two blocks from the Lawson's. A tacky, two-story building. She
walks upstairs, takes the keys out of her pocket, and opens the green paneled door. The
apartment consists of two rooms plus a kitchen and a bathroom. The walls are thin, the
floors creak, and probably the only natural light the place gets during the day is when
the blinding sunset shines in. I hear a toilet flush in some other unit, the scrape of a
cabinet being shut somewhere. Seedy, all right, but at least it has the feel of real people
living real lives. Dishes piled up in the kitchen sink, empty plastic bottles, half-read
magazines, past-their-prime potted tulips, a shopping list taped to the fridge, stockings
hanging over the back of a chair, newspaper on the table opened to the TV schedule, an
ashtray, a thin box of Virginia Slims. For some strange reason this scene relaxes me.
"This is my friend's apartment," she explains. "She used to work with me at a
salon in Tokyo, but last year she had to come back to Takamatsu, where she's from. But
then she said she wanted to travel to India for a month and asked me to watch the place.
I'm taking over her job while she's gone. She's a hairdresser too. I figured it's a good
change of pace to get out of Tokyo for a while. She's one of those New Age types, so I
doubt she'll be able to pull herself away from India in a month."
She has me sit down at the dining table, and brings me a can of Pepsi from the
fridge. No glass, though. Normally I don't drink colas--way too sweet and bad for your
teeth. But I'm dying of thirst and down the whole can.
"You want anything to eat? All I've got is Cup Noodle, if that'll do."
I'm okay, I tell her.
"You look awful. You know that?"
I nod.
"So what happened?"
"I wish I knew."
"You have no idea what happened. You didn't even know where you were. And
it's a long story," she says, pinning down the facts. "But you're definitely in trouble?"
"Definitely," I reply. I hope that, at least, gets through.
Silence. All the while, she's bathing me in a deep frown. "You don't really have
any relatives in Takamatsu, do you? You ran away from home."
Again I nod.
"Once, when I was your age, I ran away from home. I think I understand what
you're going through. That's why I gave you my cell phone number. I figured it might
come in handy."
"I really appreciate it," I say.
"I lived in Ichikawa, in Chiba. I never got along with my parents and hated school,
so I stole some money from my folks and took off, trying to get as far away as I could. I
was sixteen. I got as far as Abashiri, up in Hokkaido. I stopped by a farm I happened to
see and asked them to let me work there. I'll do anything, I told them, and I'll work hard.
I don't need any pay, as long as there's a roof over my head and you feed me. The lady
there was nice to me, had me sit down and have some tea. Just wait here, she said. The
next thing I knew a patrol car pulled up outside and the police were hauling me back
home. This wasn't the first time the lady had gone through this sort of thing. The thought
hit me hard then that I had to learn a trade, so no matter where I went I could always
find work. So I quit high school, went to a trade school, and became a hairdresser." The
edges of her lips rise a bit in a faint smile. "A pretty sound approach to things, don't you
think?"
I agree with her.
"Hey, would you tell me the whole story, from the beginning?" she says, pulling
out a cigarette and lighting it. "I don't think I'm going to get much more sleep tonight, so
I might as well hear it all."
I explain everything to her, from the time I left home. I leave out the omen part,
though. That, I know, I can't tell just anyone.
Chapter 10
Is it all right, then, if Nakata calls you Kawamura?" He repeated the question to the
striped brown cat, enunciating his words slowly, making it as easy to understand as he
could.
This particular cat had said he thought he had run across Goma, the missing oneyear-
old tortoiseshell, in this vicinity. But from Nakata's viewpoint, he spoke very
strangely. The feeling was mutual, for the cat seemed to be having its own problems
following him. Their conversation was at cross purposes.
"I don't mind at all, the tallest of heads."
"Pardon me, but Nakata doesn't understand what you're saying. Forgive me, but
I'm not so bright."
"It's a tuna, to the very end."
"Are you perhaps saying you'd like to eat a tuna?"
"No. The hands tied up, before."
Nakata never went into these conversations with cats expecting to be able to
easily communicate everything. You have to anticipate a few problems when cats and
humans try to speak to each other. And there was another factor to consider: Nakata's
own basic problems with talking--not just with cats, but also with people. His easy
conversation with Otsuka the previous week was more the exception than the rule, for
invariably getting across even a simple message took a great deal of effort. On bad days
it was more like two people on the opposite shores of a canal yelling to each other on a
windy day. And today was one of those days.
He wasn't sure why, but striped brown cats were the hardest to get on the same
wavelength with. With black cats things mostly went well. Communicating with
Siamese cats was the easiest of all, but unfortunately there weren't too many stray
Siamese wandering the streets, so the chance didn't present itself often. Siamese were
mainly kept at home, well taken care of. And for some reason striped brown cats made
up the bulk of the strays.
Even knowing what to expect, Nakata found Kawamura impossible to decipher.
He enunciated his words poorly, and Nakata couldn't catch what each one meant, or the
connection between them. What the cat said came off sounding more like riddles than
sentences. Still, Nakata was infinitely patient, and had plenty of time on his hands. He
repeated the same question, over and over, having the cat repeat his responses. The two
of them were seated on a boundary stone marking a little park for children in a
residential area. They'd been talking for nearly an hour, going round and round in circles.
"Kawamura is just a name I'll call you. It doesn't mean anything. Nakata gives
names to each cat so it's easy to remember. It won't cause you any problems, I guarantee
it. I'd just like to call you that, if you don't mind."
In response Kawamura kept muttering something incomprehensible, and seeing
as how this wasn't likely to stop anytime soon Nakata interrupted, trying to move their
talk along by showing Kawamura the photo of Goma once more.
"Mr. Kawamura, this is Goma. The cat that Nakata is looking for. A one-year-old
tortoiseshell cat. She's owned by the Koizumis of the 3-chome neighborhood in Nogata,
who lost track of her a while back. Mrs. Koizumi opened a window and the cat leaped
out and ran away. So once more I'd like to ask you, have you seen this cat?"
Kawamura gazed at the photograph again and nodded.
"If it's tuna, Kwa'mura tied. Tied up, try to find."
"I'm sorry, but as I said a moment ago, Nakata is not very bright, and can't
understand very well what you're getting at. Would you mind repeating that?"
"If it's tuna, Kwa'mura tries. Try to find and tied it up."
"By tuna, you mean the fish?"
"Tries the tuna, tie it, Kwa'mura."
Nakata rubbed his closely cropped, salt-and-pepper hair and puzzled this over.
What could he possibly do to solve this tuna riddle and escape from the maze the
conversation had become? No matter how much he put his mind to it, however, he was
clueless. Puzzling things out logically, after all, wasn't exactly his forte. Totally blithe to
it all, Kawamura lifted a rear leg and gave the spot just below his chin a good scratch.
Just then Nakata thought he heard a small laugh behind him. He turned and saw,
seated on a low concrete wall next to a house, a lovely, slim Siamese looking at him
with narrowed eyes.
"Excuse me, but would you by chance be Mr. Nakata?" the Siamese purred.
"Yes, that's correct. My name's Nakata. It's very nice to meet you."
"Likewise, I'm sure," the Siamese replied.
"It's been cloudy since this morning, but I don't expect we'll be seeing any rain
soon," Nakata said.
"I do hope the rain holds off."
The Siamese was a female, just approaching middle age. She proudly held her tail
up straight, and had a collar with a name tag. She had pleasant features and was slim,
with not an ounce of extra fat.
"Please call me Mimi. The Mimi from La Bohème. There's a song about it, too:
'Si, Mi Chiamano Mimi.'"
"I see," Nakata said, not really following.
"An opera by Puccini, you know. My owner happens to be a great fan of opera,"
Mimi said, and smiled amiably. "I'd sing it for you, but unfortunately I'm not much of a
singer."
"Nakata's very happy to meet you, Mimi-san."
"Same for me, Mr. Nakata."
"Do you live near here?"
"Yes, in that two-story house over there. The Tanabes' house. You see it, right?
The one with the cream-colored BMW 530 parked in front?"
"I see," Nakata repeated. He had no idea what a BMW was, but he did spot a
cream-colored car. That must be what she meant.
"Mr. Nakata," Mimi said, "I'm known as self-reliant, or perhaps you'd say a very
private sort of cat, and I don't normally interfere in others' affairs. But that youngster--
the one I believe you're referring to as Kawamura?--is not what I would call the
brightest kitty in the litter. When he was still young a child hit him with his bicycle, the
poor thing, and he struck his head against some concrete. Ever since then he hasn't made
much sense. So even if you are patient with him, as I see you've been, you won't get
anywhere. I've been watching for a while, and I'm afraid I couldn't just sit idly by. I
know it's forward of me to do so, but I had to say something."
"No, please don't think that. I'm very happy you told me. Nakata's as dumb as
Kawamura, I'm afraid, and can't get by without other people's help. That's why I get a
sub city from the Governor every month. So I'm very happy to hear your opinion,
Mimi."
"I take it you're looking for a cat," Mimi said. "I wasn't eavesdropping, mind you,
but just happened to overhear you as I was taking a nap here. Goma, I believe you said
the name was?"
"Yes, that's correct."
"And Kawamura has seen Goma?"
"That's what he told me. But Nakata can't figure out what he said after that."
"If you wouldn't mind, Mr. Nakata, why don't I step in and try to talk with him?
It's easier for two cats to communicate, and I'm fairly used to the way he talks. So why
don't I sound him out, then summarize it for you?"
"That would be very helpful, I'm sure."
The Siamese nodded lightly, and like a ballet dancer nimbly leaped down from
the concrete wall. Black tail held up high like a flagstaff, she leisurely walked over and
sat down beside Kawamura. He immediately began to sniff Mimi's rump, but the
Siamese gave him a swift blow to the cheek and the younger cat shrank back. With
barely a pause Mimi dealt him another blow to the nose.
"Now pay attention, you brainless dingbat! You stinky good-for-nothing!" Mimi
hissed, then turned to Nakata. "You've got to show him who's in charge up front or
you'll never get anywhere. Otherwise he'll go all spacey on you, and all you get is drivel.
It's not his fault he's this way, and I do feel sorry for him, but what are you going to do?"
"I see," Nakata said, not at all sure what he was agreeing to.
The two cats began conversing, but they spoke so quickly and softly that Nakata
wasn't able to catch any of it. Mimi grilled Kawamura in a sharp tone, the younger cat
replying timidly. Any hesitation got him another merciless slap to the face. This
Siamese cat was clever, and educated too. Nakata had met many cats up till this point,
but never before one who listened to opera and knew models of cars. Impressed, he
watched as Mimi went about her business with a brisk efficiency.
Once Mimi had heard everything she wanted to, she chased the younger cat off.
"Be on your way!" she said sharply, and he dejectedly slunk away.
Mimi affably nestled up into Nakata's lap. "I think I've got the gist of it."
"Much obliged," Nakata said.
"That cat--Kawamura, that is--said he's seen Goma several times in a grassy spot
just down the road. It's an empty lot they were planning to build on. A real estate firm
bought up a car company's parts warehouse and tore it down, planning to put up a highclass
condo. A citizens' movement's opposed the development, there was a legal battle,
and the construction's been put on hold. The sort of thing that happens all the time these
days. The lot's overgrown with grass and people hardly ever come there, so it's the
perfect hangout for all the strays in the neighborhood. I don't keep company with many
cats, and I don't want to get fleas, so I hardly ever go over there. As you're no doubt
aware, fleas are like a bad habit--awfully hard to get rid of once you get them."
"I see," Nakata said.
"He told me the cat's just like the one in the photograph--a timid, pretty young
tortoiseshell with a flea collar. Can't seem to speak that well, either. It's clear to anyone
that it's a naive house cat that can't find its way back home."
"When was this, I wonder?"
"The last time he saw the cat seems to be three or four days ago. He's not very
bright, so he's not even sure about days. But he did say it was the day after it rained, so
I'm thinking it must have been Monday. I seem to recall it rained pretty hard on
Sunday."
"Nakata doesn't know about the days of the week, but I think it did rain around
then. He hasn't seen her since?"
"That was the last time. The other cats haven't seen her either, he says. He's a
spacey, good-for-nothing cat, but I pressed him closely and believe most of what he
says."
"I really want to thank you."
"No need--it was my pleasure. Most of the time I have only this worthless bunch
of cats around here to talk to, and we never seem to agree on anything. I find it
incredibly irritating. So it's a breath of fresh air to be able to talk with a sensible human
such as yourself."
"I see," Nakata said. "There's one thing Nakata still doesn't understand. Mr.
Kawamura kept going on about tuna, and I was wondering if he meant the fish?"
Mimi lithely lifted her left front leg, inspecting the pink flesh of the pad, and
chuckled. "The youngster's terminology isn't very extensive, I'm afraid."
"Termanolgy?"
"The number of words he's familiar with is limited, is what I'm saying. So for him
everything that's good to eat is tuna. For him tuna's the crème de la crème, as far as food
goes. He doesn't know there are such things as sea bream, halibut, or yellowtail."
Nakata cleared his throat. "Actually, Nakata's very fond of tuna. Of course I like
eel as well."
"I'm fond of eel myself. Though it's not the sort of thing you can eat all the time."
"That's true. You couldn't eat it all the time."
The two of them were silent for a time, eel musings filling the passing moments.
"Anyway, what that cat was getting at is this," Mimi said, as if suddenly
remembering. "Not long after the neighborhood cats began hanging out at that vacant lot,
a bad person showed up who catches cats. The other cats believe this man may have
taken Goma away. The man lures them with something good to eat, then throws them
inside a large sack. The man's quite skilled at catching cats, and a hungry, innocent cat
like Goma would easily fall into his trap. Even the stray cats who live around here,
normally a wary bunch, have lost a couple of their number to this man. It's simply
hideous, because nothing could be worse for a cat than to be stuffed inside a bag."
"I see," Nakata said, and again rubbed his salt-and-pepper hair with his palm.
"But what does this man do with the cats once he's caught them?"
"That I don't know. In the old days they used to make shamisens out of cat skin,
but nowadays not too many people play the shamisen. And besides, I hear they mainly
use plastic now. In some parts of the world people eat cats, though not in Japan, thank
goodness. So I think we can exclude both of these as motives. Which leaves, let me see...
people who use cats in scientific experiments. Cats are used a lot in experiments. One of
my friends, in fact, was used in a psychology experiment at Tokyo University. A terrible
thing, but it's a long story and I won't go into it now. There are also perverts--not many,
mind you--who just enjoy tormenting cats. Catching a cat and chopping off its tail, for
instance."
"What do they do after they chop it off?"
"Nothing. They just want to torment and hurt the cats. Makes them feel good for
some reason. I'm afraid there are twisted people like that in the world."
Nakata gave this some thought. How could chopping off a cat's tail possibly be
fun? "So what you're saying is that maybe this twisted person has taken Goma away?"
he asked.
Mimi screwed up her long white whiskers and frowned. "I'd rather not think that,
or even imagine it, but it is a possibility. Mr. Nakata, I haven't lived all that many years,
but I've seen terrible things I never could have imagined. Most people look at cats and
think what a life--all we do is lie around in the sun, never having to lift a finger. But
cats' lives aren't that idyllic. Cats are powerless, weak little creatures that injure easily.
We don't have shells like turtles, nor wings like birds. We can't burrow into the ground
like moles or change colors like a chameleon. The world has no idea how many cats are
injured every day, how many of us meet a miserable end. I happen to be lucky enough to
live with the Tanabes in a warm and friendly family, the children treat me well, and I've
got everything I need. But even my life isn't always easy. When it comes to strays,
though, they have a very tough time of it."
"You're really smart, aren't you, Mimi?" Nakata said, impressed by the Siamese's
eloquence.
"No, not really," Mimi replied, narrowing her eyes in embarrassment. "I just
spend too much time lying in front of the TV and this is what happens--my head gets
full of worthless facts. Do you ever watch TV, Mr. Nakata?"
"No, Nakata doesn't watch TV. The people on TV talk too fast, and I can't keep
up with them. I'm dumb, so I can't read, and if you can't read TV doesn't make much
sense. Sometimes I listen to the radio, but the words there are also too fast, and it tires
me out. I much prefer doing this--enjoy talking with a cat outside, under the sky."
"Indeed," Mimi said.
"That's right," Nakata replied.
"I really hope that Goma is all right."
"Mimi, Nakata's going to have a look at that empty lot."
"According to the youngster, this man is very tall, and wears a strange tall hat and
long leather boots. And he walks fast. He looks very unusual, so you'll recognize him
right away, he told me. Whenever the cats that gather at the empty lot see him coming,
they scatter in all directions. But a newcomer might not know enough to...."
Nakata stored this information away in his head, carefully folding it all away in a
front drawer so he wouldn't forget it. The man is very tall, and wears a strange tall hat
and long leather boots....
"I hope I've been of help," Mimi said.
"Nakata appreciates everything you've done. If you hadn't been kind enough to
speak up I'd still be going round and round about tuna. I'm grateful."
"What I think," Mimi said, gazing up at Nakata with knit brows, "is that that man
is trouble. A lot of trouble. He's more dangerous than you can ever imagine. If it were
me I'd never go near that lot. But you're a human, and it's your job, after all, but I hope
you'll take every precaution."
"Thank you very kindly. I'll be as careful as I can."
"Mr. Nakata, this world is a terribly violent place. And nobody can escape the
violence. Please keep that in mind. You can't be too cautious. The same holds true for
cats and human beings."
"I'll remember that," Nakata replied.
But he had no idea where and how the world could be violent. The world was full
of things Nakata couldn't comprehend, and most things connected with violence fell into
that category.
After saying good-bye to Mimi, he went to see the empty lot, which turned out to
be about the size of a small playground. A tall plywood fence enclosed the lot, with a
sign on it saying KEEP OUT: SITE OF FUTURE CONSTRUCTION (which Nakata,
naturally, couldn't read). A heavy chain blocked the entrance, but around back was a gap
in the fence, and he easily got inside. Someone must have pried it open.
All the warehouses that had originally stood there had been torn down, but the
land hadn't been graded for construction and was covered with grass. Goldenrod grew as
high as a child, a couple of butterflies flickering above it. Mounds of earth had hardened
in the rain, in some places rising up in little hillocks. A perfect place for cats. People
wouldn't come in, and there were all sorts of little creatures to catch and plenty of places
to hide.
Kawamura was nowhere to be seen. Two scrawny cats with rough coats were
there, but when Nakata called out a friendly greeting they just glanced at him coldly and
disappeared into the weeds. Which made sense--none of them wanted to get caught and
have his tail chopped off. Nakata himself certainly didn't want to have that happen to
him, not that he had a tail. It was no wonder the cats were wary of him.
Nakata stood on higher ground and took a good look around. No one else was
there, just the butterflies, searching for something, fluttering above the weeds. He found
a good spot to sit down, lowered his canvas bag from his shoulder, took out two beanjam
buns, and had his usual lunch. He drank hot tea from a thermos, eyes narrowed as
he quietly sipped. Just a quiet early afternoon. Everything was at rest, placid,
harmonious. Nakata found it hard to believe that somebody might be lying in wait to
torment and torture cats.
He rubbed his cropped salt-and-pepper hair as he chewed. If somebody else was
with him he could explain--Nakata's not very bright--but unfortunately he was alone. All
he could do was nod a few times to himself and continue chewing. Once he finished the
buns he folded up the cellophane they'd been wrapped in into a compact square and put
it in his bag. He screwed the lid back on the thermos tight and put it in his bag as well.
The sky was covered with a layer of clouds, but from their color he could tell the sun
was almost directly overhead.
The man is very tall, and wears a strange tall hat and long leather boots.
Nakata tried to picture this man, but had no idea what a strange tall hat and long
leather boots looked like. In his whole life he'd never encountered any tall hats and long
leather boots. Kawamura had told Mimi that you'd know him when you saw him. So,
Nakata decided, I suppose I'll just have to wait until I see him. That's definitely the best
plan. He stood up and relieved himself in the weeds--a long, honest pee--and then went
over to a clump of weeds in a corner of the vacant lot, where he had the best chance of
remaining hidden from sight, and sat out the rest of the afternoon, waiting for that
strange man to show up.
Waiting was a boring task. He had no clue when the man might next appear--
maybe tomorrow, maybe not for a week. Or maybe he'd never show up again--there was
that possibility. But Nakata was used to aimless waiting and spending time alone, doing
nothing. He wasn't bothered in the least.
Time wasn't the main issue for him. He didn't even own a watch. Nakata operated
on his own sense of time. In the morning it got light, in the evening the sun set and it got
dark. Once it got dark he'd go to the nearby public bath, and after coming home from his
bath he'd go to sleep. The public bath was closed on certain days of the week, and when
that happened he'd just give up and go back home. His stomach told him when it was
time to eat, and when the time came for him to go pick up his sub city (somebody was
always nice enough to tell him when that day was near) he knew another month had
passed. The next day he'd always go for a haircut at the local barber shop. Every
summer someone from the ward office would treat him to eel, and every New Year
they'd bring him rice cakes.
Nakata let his body relax, switched off his mind, allowing things to flow through
him. This was natural for him, something he'd done ever since he was a child, without a
second thought. Before long the borders of his consciousness fluttered around, just like
the butterflies. Beyond these borders lay a dark abyss. Occasionally his consciousness
would fly over the border and hover over that dizzying, black crevass. But Nakata wasn't
afraid of the darkness or how deep it was. And why should he be? That bottomless
world of darkness, that weighty silence and chaos, was an old friend, a part of him
already. Nakata understood this well. In that world there was no writing, no days of the
week, no scary Governor, no opera, no BMWs. No scissors, no tall hats. On the other
hand, there was also no delicious eel, no tasty bean-jam buns. Everything is there, but
there are no parts. Since there are no parts, there's no need to replace one thing with
another. No need to remove anything, or add anything. You don't have to think about
difficult things, just let yourself soak it all in. For Nakata, nothing could be better.
Occasionally he dozed off. Even when he slept, though, his senses, ever vigilant,
kept watch over the vacant lot. If something happened, if somebody came, he could
wake up and do what needed to be done. The sky was covered with a flat line of gray
clouds, but at least it wasn't going to rain. The cats all knew it. And so did Nakata.
Chapter 11
When I finish talking it's pretty late. Sakura listens intently the whole time, resting her
head in her hands on the kitchen table. I tell her that I'm actually fifteen, in junior high,
that I stole my father's money and ran away from my home in Nakano Ward in Tokyo.
That I'm staying in a hotel in Takamatsu and spending my days reading at a library. That
all of a sudden I found myself collapsed outside a shrine, covered with blood.
Everything. Well, almost everything. Not the important stuff I can't talk about.
"So your mother left home with your older sister when you were just four.
Leaving you and your father behind."
I take the photo of my sister and me at the shore from my wallet and show her.
"This is my sister," I say. Sakura looks at the photo for a while, then hands it back
without a word.
"I haven't seen her since then," I say. "Or my mom. She's never gotten in touch,
and I have no idea where she is. I don't even remember what she looks like. There aren't
any photos of her left. I remember her smell, her touch, but not her face."
"Hmm," Sakura says. Head still in her hands, she narrows her eyes and looks at
me. "Must have been hard on you."
"Yeah, I guess...."
She continues to gaze at me silently. "So you didn't get along with your dad?" she
asks after a while.
Didn't get along? How am I supposed to answer that? I don't say anything, just
shake my head.
"Dumb question--of course you didn't. Otherwise you wouldn't have run away,"
Sakura says. "So anyway, you left your home, and today you suddenly lost
consciousness or your memory or something."
"Yeah."
"Did that ever happen before?"
"Sometimes," I tell her honestly. "I fly into a rage, and it's like I blow a fuse. Like
somebody pushes a switch in my head and my body does its thing before my mind can
catch up. It's like I'm here, but in a way it's not me."
"You lose control and do something violent, you mean?"
"It's happened a few times, yeah."
"Have you hurt anybody?"
I nod. "Twice I did. Nothing serious."
She thinks about this.
"Is that what happened this time?"
I shake my head. "This is the first time something this bad's happened. This time...
I don't know how it started, and I can't remember at all what happened. It's like my
memory was wiped clean. It never was this bad before."
She looks over the T-shirt I haul out of my backpack, carefully checking the
blood I couldn't wash out. "So the last thing you remember is eating dinner, right? At a
restaurant near the station?"
I nod.
"And everything after that's a blank. The next thing you knew, you were lying in
the bushes behind that shrine. About four hours later. Your shirt covered in blood and
your left shoulder aching?"
I give her another nod. She brings over a city map from somewhere and checks
out the distance between the station and the shrine.
"It's not so far, but it would take a while to walk. But why would you have been
over there in the first place? It's the opposite direction from your hotel. Have you ever
gone there before?"
"Never."
"Take off your shirt for a minute," she says.
I strip bare to the waist, and she walks behind me and grabs my left shoulder hard.
Her fingers dig into my flesh, and I can't help but gasp. This girl's pretty strong.
"Does it hurt?"
"You bet it does," I say.
"You hit something pretty hard. Or something hit you."
"I don't remember a thing."
"Anyway, nothing's broken," she says. She proceeds to prod around the sore spot,
and aside from the pain, her fingers feel really nice. When I tell her so she smiles.
"I've always been good at giving massages. It's a useful skill for a hairdresser."
She keeps on massaging my shoulder. "Doesn't look like anything major. Give it
a good night's sleep and you should feel better."
She picks up my T-shirt, puts it in a plastic bag, and tosses it in the garbage. My
dungaree shirt she gives a once-over and throws in the washing machine. She rummages
around in her dresser and comes up with a white T-shirt. She hands it to me, a brandnew
white shirt that says Maui Whale Watching Cruise on it, with a picture of a fluke
sticking out of the water.
"This is the biggest shirt I could find. It's not mine, but don't worry about it. It's
just a souvenir from somebody. Might not be your style, but give it a try."
I tug the shirt on, and it fits perfectly.
"You can keep it if you want," she says.
I thank her.
"So you never had such a total memory loss before?" she asks.
I nod, then close my eyes, feeling the T-shirt, taking in its new smell. "Sakura,
I'm really scared," I tell her. "I don't know what to do. I don't have any memory of
hurting anybody. Whatever it was got me covered in blood, but I can't remember
anything. If I committed a crime, I'm still legally responsible, right, whether I have a
memory of it or not?"
"Maybe it was just a nosebleed. Somebody was walking down the street, bumped
into a telephone pole, and got a bloody nose. And all you did was help them out. See? I
understand why you're worried, but let's try not to think about worst-case scenarios,
okay? At least not tonight. In the morning we can look in the paper, watch the news on
TV. If something terrible really happened, we'll know about it. Then we can consider
our options. There're plenty of reasons why someone might get bloody, and most of the
time it's not nearly as bad as it looks. I'm a girl, so I'm used to seeing blood--I see that
much every month. You know what I mean?"
I nod, and feel myself blushing a little. She scoops a little Nescafé into a big cup
and heats up some water in a small pan. She smokes, waiting for the water to boil. She
takes a couple of puffs, then extinguishes the cigarette with tap water. I catch a whiff of
menthol.
"I don't mean to pry, but there's something I want to ask you. Do you mind?"
"I don't mind," I tell her.
"Your older sister was adopted. They got her from somewhere before you were
born, right?"
"That's right," I reply. "I don't know why, but my parents adopted her. After that I
was born. Not exactly what they had in mind, I imagine."
"So you're definitely the child of your mother and father."
"As far I know," I tell her.
"But when your mother left, she didn't take you, but took your sister, who's
unrelated to her," Sakura says. "Not what you'd normally expect a woman to do."
I don't say anything.
"Why'd she do that?"
I shake my head. "I have no idea," I tell her. "I've asked myself the same question
a million times."
"That must have hurt."
Did it? "I don't know. But if I get married someday I don't think I'll have any kids.
I wouldn't have any idea how to get along with them if I did."
"My situation wasn't as complicated as yours," she says, "but I didn't get along
with my folks for a long time, and I got mixed up in a lot of stupid things because of it.
So I know how you feel. But it's not a good idea to make decisions so soon. There's no
such thing as absolutes."
She stands in front of the kitchen stove and sips her Nescafé, steam rising from
the large cup. The cup has a drawing of the Moomin cartoon characters on it. She
doesn't say anything, and neither do I.
"Do you have anybody, relatives or someone, who can help?" she asks after a
while.
"No," I say. "My father's parents died a long time ago, and he doesn't have any
brothers, sisters, uncles, or aunts. Not a one. Not that I can prove this. But I do know he
never had anything to do with any relatives. And I never heard anything about relatives
on my mother's side. I mean, I don't even know my mother's name--so how was I
supposed to know about her relatives?"
"Your father sounds like an alien from outer space or something," Sakura says.
"Like he came from some far-off planet, took on human form, kidnapped an Earth
woman, and then had you. Just so he could have more descendants. Your mother found
out, got frightened, and ran away. Like in some film noir science-fiction flick."
I have no idea what to say.
"All joking aside," she says, and smiles broadly to show that she means it, "my
point is, in this whole wide world the only person you can depend on is you."
"I guess so."
She stands there leaning against the sink, drinking her coffee.
"I have to get some sleep," she says, as if suddenly remembering. It's past three.
"I have to get up at seven-thirty so I won't get much, but a little's better than none. I hate
going to work on no sleep at all. So what're you going to do?"
"I have my sleeping bag with me," I tell her, "so if it's no bother I'll just sack out
in a corner." I take my tightly rolled-up sleeping bag out of my backpack, spread it out,
and fluff it up.
She watches, impressed. "A regular Boy Scout," she says.
After she turns out the light and gets in bed, I climb into my sleeping bag, shut
my eyes, and try to go to sleep. But I can't stop picturing that bloody white T-shirt. I still
feel that burning sensation in my palm. I open my eyes and stare at the ceiling. A floor
creaks somewhere. Somebody turns on a faucet. And again I hear an ambulance in the
night, far off but echoing sharply in the darkness.
"Can't fall asleep?" she whispers in the dark.
"No," I say.
"Me neither. Shouldn't have had that coffee. That was dumb." She switches on
her bedside light, checks the time, then turns the light off. "Don't get me wrong," she
says, "but if you'd like to come over here you can. I can't get to sleep either."
I slip out of my sleeping bag and climb in bed with her. I'm wearing boxers and
the T-shirt. She has on a pair of light pink pajamas.
"I have a steady boyfriend in Tokyo," she tells me. "He's not much to brag about,
but he's my guy. So I don't have sex with anybody else. I might not look like it, but
when it comes to sex I'm pretty straightlaced. Call me old-fashioned. I wasn't always
that way--I used to be pretty wild--but I don't fool around anymore. So don't get any
ideas, okay? Just think of us as brother and sister. You understand?"
"Gotcha," I tell her.
She puts her arms around me, hugs me close, and rests her cheek on my forehead.
"You poor thing," she says.
I don't need to tell you that I get a hard-on right away. Big time. And it couldn't
help rubbing up against her thigh.
"My oh my!" she says.
"Sorry," I tell her. "I didn't mean to."
"It's okay," she says. "I know what an inconvenience it is. Nothing you can do to
stop it."
I nod in the darkness.
She hesitates for a moment, then lowers my boxers, pulls out my rock-hard cock,
and cradles it gently in her hand. Like she's making sure of something, the way a doctor
takes a pulse. With her soft hand touching me, I feel something--a stray thought, maybe-
-spring up in my crotch.
"How old would your sister be now?"
"Twenty-one," I say. "Six years older than me."
She thinks about this for a while. "Do you want to see her?"
"Maybe," I say.
"Maybe?" Her hand grasps my cock a little harder. "What do you mean, maybe?
You really don't want to see her that much?"
"I don't know what we'd talk about, and she might not want to see me. Same thing
with my mother. Maybe neither one of them wants to have anything to do with me. No
one's searching for me. I mean, they left and everything." Without me, I silently
complete the thought.
She doesn't say anything. Her hand on my cock loosens a bit, then tightens. In
time with this my cock relaxes, then gets even harder.
"You want to come?" she asks.
"Maybe," I say.
"Again with the maybes?"
"Very much," I correct myself.
She sighs lightly and slowly begins to move her hand. It feels out of this world.
Not just an up-and-down motion, but more of an all-over massage. Her fingers gently
stroke my cock and my balls. I close my eyes and let out a big sigh.
"You can't touch me. And when you're about to come let me know so you don't
mess up the sheets."
"Okay," I say.
"How is it? I'm pretty good, huh?"
"Fantastic."
"Like I was telling you, I'm very nimble-fingered. But this isn't sex, okay? I'm
just--helping you relax, is what it is. You've had a rough day, you're all tense, and you're
not going to sleep well unless we do something about it. Got it?"
"Yeah, I get it," I say. "But I do have one request."
"What's that?"
"Is it okay if I imagine you naked?"
Her hand stops and she looks me in the eyes. "You want to imagine me naked
while we're doing this?"
"Yeah. I've been trying to keep from imagining that, but I can't."
"Really?"
"It's like a TV you can't turn off."
She laughs. "I don't get it. You didn't have to tell me that! Why don't you just go
ahead and imagine what you want? You don't need my permission. How can I know
what's in your head?"
"I can't help it. Imagining something's very important, so I thought I'd better tell
you. It has nothing to do with whether you know or not."
"You are some kind of polite boy, aren't you," she says, impressed. "I guess it's
nice, though, that you wanted to let me know. All right, permission granted. Go ahead
and picture me nude."
"Thanks," I say.
"How is it? Is my body nice?"
"It's amazing," I reply.
This languid sensation spreads over my lower half, like a liquid floating to the
surface. When I tell her, she grabs some tissue from the bedside, and I come, over and
over, like crazy.... A little while later she goes to the kitchen, tosses away the tissue
paper, and rinses her hand.
"Sorry," I say.
"It's all right," she says, snuggling back into bed. "No need to apologize. It's just a
part of your body. So--do you feel better?"
"Definitely."
"I'm glad." She thinks for a while, then says, "I was thinking how nice it'd be if I
was your real sister."
"Me too," I say.
She lightly touches my hair. "I'm going to sleep now, so why don't you go back to
your sleeping bag. I can't sleep well unless I'm alone, and I don't want your hard-on
poking me all night, okay?"
I go back to my sleeping bag and close my eyes. This time I can get to sleep. A
deep, deep sleep, maybe the deepest since I ran away from home. It's like I'm in some
huge elevator that slowly, silently carries me deeper and deeper underground. Finally all
light has disappeared, all sound faded away.
When I wake up, Sakura's gone off to work. It's nine a. m. My shoulder hardly
aches at all anymore. Just like she said. On the kitchen table I find a folded-up morning
paper, a note, and a key.
Her note says: I watched the TV news at seven and looked through the entire
paper, but there weren't any bloody incidents reported around here. So I don't think that
blood was anything. Good news, huh? There isn't much in the fridge, but help yourself.
And make use of whatever you need around the house. If you aren't planning to go
anywhere, feel free to hang out here. Just put the key under the doormat if you go out.
I grab a carton of milk from the fridge, check the expiration date, and pour it over
some cornflakes, boil some water, and make a cup of Darjeeling tea. Toast two slices of
bread, and eat them with some low-fat margarine. Then I open the newspaper and scan
the local news. Like she said, no violent crimes in the headlines. I let out a sigh of relief,
fold up the paper, and put it back where it was. At least I won't have to run all over
trying to evade the cops. But I decide it's better not to go back to the hotel, just to play it
safe. I still don't know what happened during those lost four hours.
I call the hotel. A man answers, and I don't recognize his voice. I tell him
something's come up and I have to check out. I try my best to sound grown-up. I've paid
in advance so that shouldn't be a problem. There are some personal effects in the room, I
tell him, but they can be discarded. He checks the computer and sees that the bill's up-todate.
"Everything's in order, Mr. Tamura," he says. "You're all checked out." The key's a
plastic card, so there's no need to return it. I thank him and hang up.
I take a shower. Sakura's underwear and stockings are drying out in the bathroom.
I try not to look at them and concentrate on my usual job of thoroughly scrubbing
myself. And I try my best not to think about last night. I brush my teeth and put on a pair
of new shorts, roll up my sleeping bag and stuff it in my backpack, then wash my dirty
clothes in the washer. There's no dryer, so after they go through the spin cycle I fold
them up and put them in a plastic bag and into my pack. I can always dry them at a coin
laundry later on.
I wash all the dishes piled up in the sink, let them drain, dry them, and place them
back in the shelf. Then I straighten up the contents of the fridge and toss whatever's
gone bad. Some of the food stinks--moldy broccoli, an ancient, rubbery cucumber, a
pack of tofu well past its expiration date. I take whatever's still edible, transfer it to new
containers, and wipe up some spilled sauce. I throw away all the cigarette butts, make a
neat stack of the scattered old newspapers, and run a vacuum around the place. Sakura
might be good at giving a massage, but when it comes to keeping house she's a disaster.
I iron the shirts she's crammed in the dresser, and think about going shopping and
making dinner. At home I tried to take care of household chores myself, so none of this
is any trouble. But making dinner, I decide, might be going too far.
Finished with all that, I sit down at the kitchen table and look around the
apartment. I know I can't stay here forever. I'd have a semipermanent hard-on, with
semipermanent fantasies. Can't avoid looking at those tiny black panties hanging in the
bathroom, can't keep asking her permission to let my imagination roam. But most of all I
can't forget what she did for me last night.
I leave a note for Sakura, using the blunt pencil and the memo pad beside the
phone. Thanks. You really saved me. I'm sorry I woke you up so late last night. But
you're the only one I could count on. I stop for a moment to think what I should write
next, and do a three-sixty of the room as I'm thinking. Thanks for letting me stay over.
I'm grateful you said I could stay here as long I liked. It would be nice if I could, but I
don't think I should bother you anymore. There're all sorts of reasons I won't go into.
I've got to make it on my own. I hope you'll still think kindly of me the next time I'm in
a jam.
I stop again. Someone in the neighborhood's got their TV on at full volume, one
of those morning talk shows for housewives. The people on the show all yelling at each
other, and commercials just as loud and obnoxious. I sit at the table, spinning the blunt
pencil in my hand, pulling my thoughts together. To tell the truth, though, I don't think I
deserve your kindness. I'm trying my best to be a much better person, but things aren't
going so well. The next time we meet I hope I'll have my act together. Whether that will
happen or not, I don't know. Thanks for last night. It was wonderful.
I slip the note under a cup, shoulder my backpack, and head out of the apartment,
leaving the key under the doormat like she said. A black-and-white spotted cat's lying in
the middle of the stairs, taking a nap. He must be used to people because he doesn't
make a move to get up as I go down the stairs. I sit down beside him and stroke his large
body for a while. The feel of his fur brings back memories. The cat narrows his eyes and
starts to purr. We sit there on the stairs for a long time, each enjoying his own version of
this intimate feeling. Finally I tell him good-bye and walk down the road. A fine rain's
begun to fall.
Having checked out of the hotel and left Sakura's, I have no idea where I'll spend
the night. Before the sun sets I've got to find a roof to sleep under, someplace safe. I
don't know where to begin but decide to take the train out to the Komura Library. Once I
get there, something will work out. I don't know why, but I just have a feeling it will.
Fate seems to be taking me in some even stranger directions.
Chapter 12
October 19, 1972
Dear Professor,
I'm sure you must be quite surprised to receive a letter from me, out of the blue.
Please forgive me for being so forward. I imagine that you no longer remember my
name, Professor, but I was at one time a teacher at a small elementary school in
Yamanashi Prefecture. When you read this, you may recall something about me. I was
the teacher in charge of the group of children on a field trip, the ones involved in the
incident in which the children all lost consciousness. Afterward, as you may remember,
I had the opportunity to speak with you and your colleagues from the university in
Tokyo several times when you visited our town with people from the military to
investigate.
In the years following I've often seen your name mentioned prominently in the
press, and I have followed your career and achievements with the deepest admiration. At
the same time, I have fond memories of when we met, especially your very businesslike,
brisk way of speaking. I feel blessed, too, to have been able to read several of your
books. I've always been impressed by your insights, and I find the worldview that runs
through all of your publications very convincing--namely that as individuals each of us
is extremely isolated, while at the same time we are all linked by a prototypical memory.
There have been times in my own life that I felt exactly this way. From afar, then, I pray
for your continued success.
After that incident I continued to teach at the same elementary school. A few
years ago, however, I unexpectedly fell ill, was hospitalized for a long spell in Kofu
General Hospital, and, after some time, submitted my resignation. For a year I was in
and out of the hospital, but eventually I recovered, was discharged, and opened a small
tutorial school in our town. My students were the children of my former pupils. It's a
trite observation, perhaps, but it is true what they say--that time does fly--and I've found
the passage of time to be incredibly swift.
During the war I lost both my husband and my father, then my mother as well in
the confused period following the surrender. With my husband off to war soon after we
married, we never had any children, so I've been all alone in the world. I wouldn't say
my life has been happy, but it has been a great blessing to have been able to teach for so
long and have the chance to work with so many children over the years. I thank God for
this opportunity. If it hadn't been for teaching I don't think I'd have been able to survive.
I summoned up my courage today to write to you, Professor, because I've never
been able to forget that incident in the woods in the fall of 1944. Twenty-eight years
have passed, but to me it's as fresh in my mind as if it took place yesterday. Those
memories are always with me, shadowing my every waking moment. I've spent
countless sleepless nights pondering it all, and it's even haunted my dreams.
It's as if the aftershocks of that incident affect every aspect of my life. To give
you an example, whenever I run across any of the children involved in the incident (half
of whom still live here in town and are now in their mid-thirties) I always wonder what
effects the incident had on them, and on myself. Something as traumatic as that you'd
think would have to have some lingering physical or psychological impact on all of us. I
can't believe otherwise. But when it comes to pinpointing what sort of effects these were,
and how great an impact it all had, I'm at a loss.
As you're well aware, Professor, the military kept news of this incident from
reaching the public. During the Occupation the American military conducted their own
investigation behind closed doors. The military's always the same, whether Japanese or
American. Even when censorship was lifted after the Occupation, no articles about the
incident appeared in newspapers or magazines. Which I suppose is understandable,
since it had taken place years before and no one had died.
Because of this, most people are unaware that such an incident ever took place.
During the war there were so many horrific events, and millions of people lost their lives,
so I don't suppose people would be very shocked by what happened in our little town.
Even here not many people remember what happened, and those who do don't appear
willing to talk about it. I'd say most people who recall the incident find it an unpleasant
memory they'd prefer not to touch on.
Most things are forgotten over time. Even the war itself, the life-and-death
struggle people went through, is now like something from the distant past. We're so
caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past, like ancient stars that have
burned out, are no longer in orbit around our minds. There are just too many things we
have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn. New styles, new
information, new technology, new terminology... But still, no matter how much time
passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never
assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us forever, like
a touchstone. And for me, what happened in the woods that day is one of these.
I realize there's nothing I can do about it now, and I would certainly understand if
you are puzzled about why I'm bringing this up at this late date. But while I'm still alive
there's something I have to get off my chest.
During the war, of course, we lived under strict censorship, and there were things
we couldn't easily talk about. When I met you, Professor, there were military officers
with us and I couldn't speak freely. Also, I didn't know anything about you then, or
about your work, so I certainly didn't feel--as a young woman talking to a man she didn't
know--I could be candid about any private matter. Thus I kept several facts to myself. In
other words, in the official investigation I intentionally changed some of the facts about
the incident. And when, after the war, the American military interviewed me, I stuck to
my story. Out of fear and to keep up appearances, perhaps, I repeated the same lies I'd
told you. This may well have made it more difficult for you to investigate the incident,
and may have somewhat skewed your conclusions. No, I know it did. This has bothered
me for years, and I'm ashamed of what I did.
I hope this explains why I've written this long letter to you. I realize you're a busy
man and may not have time for this. If so, please feel free to treat it all as the ramblings
of an old woman and toss the letter away. The thing is, I feel the need, while I'm still
able, to confess all that really took place then, write it down, and pass it along to
someone who should know. I recovered from my illness, but you never know when
there might be a relapse. I hope you will take this into consideration.
The night before I took the children up into the hills, I had a dream about my
husband, just before dawn. He had been drafted and was off at war. The dream was
extremely realistic and sexually charged--one of those dreams that's so vivid it's hard to
distinguish between dream and reality.
In the dream we were lying on a large flat rock having sex. It was a light gray
rock near the top of a mountain. The whole thing was about the size of two tatami mats,
the surface smooth and damp. It was cloudy and looked like it was about to storm, but
there wasn't any wind. It seemed near twilight, and birds were hurrying off to their nests.
So there the two of us were, under that cloudy sky, silently having intercourse. We
hadn't been married long at this time, and the war had separated us. My body was
burning for my husband.
I felt an indescribable pleasure. We tried all sorts of positions and did it over and
over, climaxing again and again. It's strange, now that I think of it, for in real life the
two of us were quiet, rather introverted people. We'd never given in to our passions like
this or experienced such soaring pleasure. But in the dream, for the first time in our lives,
we'd thrown away all restraints and were going at it like animals.
When I opened my eyes it was still dim outside and I felt very odd. My body felt
heavy, and I could still feel my husband deep inside me. My heart was pounding and I
found it hard to breathe. My vagina was wet, just like after intercourse. It felt as if I'd
really made love and not just dreamed it. I'm embarrassed to say it, but I masturbated at
this point. I was burning with lust and had to do something to calm down.
Afterward I rode my bike to school as usual and escorted the children on our field
trip to Owan yama. As we walked up the mountain path I could still feel the lingering
effects of sex. All I had to do was close my eyes and I could feel my husband coming
inside me, his semen shooting against the wall of my womb. I'd clung to him for all I
was worth, my legs spread as wide as possible, my ankles entangled with his thighs. I
was, frankly, in a daze as I took the children up the hill. I felt like I was still in the
middle of that realistic, erotic dream.
We climbed up the mountain, reached the spot we were aiming at, and just as the
children were getting ready to fan out to hunt for mushrooms, my period suddenly
started. It wasn't time for it. My last one had stopped only ten days before, and my
periods were always regular. Perhaps this erotic dream had stirred something up inside
me and set it off. Naturally I hadn't come prepared, and here we were in the hills far
from town.
I instructed the children to take a short break, then I went off alone far into the
woods and took care of myself as best I could with a couple of towels I'd brought along.
There was a great deal of blood, and it made quite a mess, but I was sure I'd be able to
manage until we made it back to school. My head was a complete blank, and I couldn't
focus at all. I had a guilty conscience, I imagine--about that uninhibited dream, about
masturbating, and about having sexual fantasies in front of the children. I was usually
the type who suppressed those kinds of thoughts.
I had the children go off to gather their mushrooms, and was thinking we'd better
make it a short trip and go back as soon as we could. Back at school I'd be able to clean
up better. I sat down and watched the children as they hunted for mushrooms. I kept a
head count, and made sure none of them were out of my sight.
After a while, though, I noticed one little boy walking toward me with something
in his hands. It was the boy named Nakata--the same boy who didn't regain
consciousness and was hospitalized. He was holding the bloody towels I'd used. I
gasped and couldn't believe my eyes. I'd hidden them far away, out of sight, where the
children wouldn't go. You have to understand that this is the most embarrassing thing
for a woman, something you don't want anybody else to see. How he was able to unearth
them I have no idea.
Before I realized what I was doing, I was slapping him. I grabbed him by the
shoulders and was slapping him hard on the cheeks. I might have been yelling
something, I don't recall. I was out of control, no longer in my right mind. I think the
embarrassment must have been so great I was in shock. I'd never, ever struck one of the
children before. But it wasn't me who was doing it.
Suddenly I noticed all the children there, staring at me. Some were standing,
some sitting, all of them facing me. It was all right in front of them--me, pale, standing
there, Nakata collapsed on the ground from all the blows, the bloody towels. It was a
moment frozen in time. Nobody moved, nobody said a word. The children were
expressionless, their faces like bronze masks. A deep silence descended on the woods.
All you could hear were the birds chirping. I can't get that scene out of my mind.
I don't know how much time passed. Probably not so long, but it seemed like
forever--time driving me to the very edge of the world. Finally I snapped out of it. Color
had returned to the world around me. I hid the bloody towels behind me and lifted
Nakata up from where he lay. I held him tight and apologized to him as best I could. I
was wrong, please, please forgive me, I begged him. He looked like he was still in shock.
His eyes were blank, and I don't think he could hear what I said. With him still in my
arms I turned to the other children and told them to resume their mushroom hunting.
They probably couldn't comprehend what had just taken place. It was all too strange, too
sudden.
I stood there for a while, holding Nakata tight in my arms, feeling like I wanted to
die or disappear. Just over the horizon the violence of war went on, with countless
people dying. I no longer had any idea what was right and what was wrong. Was I really
seeing the real world? Was the sound of birds I was hearing real? I found myself alone
in the woods, totally confused, blood flowing freely from my womb. I was angry, afraid,
embarrassed--all of these rolled into one. I cried quietly, without making a sound.
And that's when the children collapsed.
I wasn't about to tell the military people what had really happened. It was wartime,
and we had to keep up appearances. So I left out the part about my period starting, about
Nakata finding the bloody towels, and me hitting him. Again, I'm afraid this threw an
obstacle in your path as you investigated the incident. You can't imagine how relieved I
am to finally get it off my chest.
Strangely enough, none of the children had any memory of the incident. Nobody
remembered the bloody towels or me beating Nakata. Those memories had fallen away
completely from their minds. Later, soon after the incident, I was able to indirectly
sound out each child and confirm that this was indeed the case. Perhaps the mass coma
had already started by then.
I'd like to say a few things about young Nakata, as his former homeroom teacher.
What happened to him after the incident, I don't really know. When I was interviewed
after the war the American officer told me he'd been taken to a hospital in Tokyo and
finally regained consciousness. But he wouldn't tell me any details. I imagine that you
know more about this than I do, Professor.
Nakata was one of the five children evacuated to our town from Tokyo, and of the
five he was the brightest and had the best grades. He had very pleasant features and
always dressed well. He was a gentle boy and never butted in where he didn't belong.
Never once during class did he volunteer an answer, but when I called on him, he
always gave the correct answer, and when I asked his opinion he'd give a logical reply.
He caught on right away, no matter what the subject. Every class has a student like that,
one who'll study what he needs to without supervision, who you know will one day
attend a top college and get an excellent job. A child who's innately capable.
But as his teacher I will say there were a couple of things about him that bothered
me. Every so often I felt a sense of resignation in him. Even when he did well on
difficult assignments, he never seemed happy. He never struggled to succeed, never
seemed to experience the pain of trial and error. He never sighed or cracked a smile. It
was as if these were things he had to get through, so he just did them. He handled
whatever came his way efficiently--like a factory worker, screwdriver in hand, working
on a conveyor belt, tightening a screw on each part that comes down the line.
I've never met his parents so I can't say anything for certain, but there had to be a
problem back home. I'd seen a number of cases like this. Adults constantly raise the bar
on smart children, precisely because they're able to handle it. The children get
overwhelmed by the tasks in front of them and gradually lose the sort of openness and
sense of accomplishment they innately have. When they're treated like that, children
start to crawl inside a shell and keep everything inside. It takes a lot of time and effort to
get them to open up again. Kids' hearts are malleable, but once they gel it's hard to get
them back the way they were. Next to impossible, in most cases. But maybe I shouldn't
be giving my opinions on the matter--this is, after all, your area of expertise.
I also sensed a hint of violence in the boy's background. Sometimes there'd be a
flash of fear in his eyes that seemed an instinctive reaction to long-term exposure to
violence. What level of violence this was, I had no way of knowing. Nakata was a very
self-disciplined child and good at hiding his fear. But there'd be the occasional
involuntary flinch, ever so slight, that he couldn't cover up. I knew that something
violent had taken place in his home. After you spend a lot of time with children, you
pick up on these things.
Rural families can be pretty violent. Most of the parents are farmers, all of them
struggling to make ends meet. They're exhausted, doing backbreaking work from
morning to night, and when they have a bit to drink and get angry, they're liable to strike
out physically. It's no secret this kind of thing goes on, and most of the time the farm
kids take it in stride and survive with no emotional scars. But Nakata's father was a
university professor, and his mother, from what I could gather from the letters she sent
me, was a welleducated woman. An upper-middle-class urban family, in other words. If
there was any violence taking place in a family like that, it was bound to be something
more complicated and less direct than what farm kids experience. The kind of violence a
child keeps wrapped up inside himself.
That's why I especially regretted hitting him on the mountain that day, whether I
did it unconsciously or not. I should never have acted that way, and I've felt guilty and
ashamed ever since. I regret it even more since Nakata--after being dragged away from
his parents and placed in an unfamiliar environment--was finally on the verge of
opening up to me before the incident.
The kind of violence I displayed then may very well have dealt a fatal blow to
whatever feelings had been budding inside him. I was hoping for an opportunity to
repair the harm I'd caused, but circumstances dictated otherwise. Still unconscious,
Nakata was taken to the hospital in Tokyo, and I never saw him again. It's something I
regret to this day. I can still see the look on his face as I was beating him. The
tremendous fear and resignation he felt at that instant.
I'm sorry, I didn't plan to write such a long letter, but there is one more thing I
have to mention. To tell the truth, when my husband died in the Philippines just before
the end of the war, it wasn't that much of a shock. I didn't feel any despair or anger--just
a deep sense of helplessness. I didn't cry at all. I already knew that somewhere, on some
distant battlefield, my husband would lose his life. Ever since the year before, when all
those things I just wrote about took place--that erotic dream, my period starting ahead of
time, hitting Nakata, the children falling into that mysterious coma--I'd accepted my
husband's death as inevitable, as something fated to be. So news of his death merely
confirmed what I already knew. The whole experience on the hill was beyond anything
I've ever experienced. I feel like I left a part of my soul in those woods.
In closing, I'd like to express my hope that your research will continue to flourish.
Please take good care of yourself.
Sincerely yours,
Chapter 13
It's after twelve, and I'm eating lunch and gazing at the garden when Oshima comes over
and sits down next to me. Today I've pretty much got the library to myself. As always
my lunch is the cheapest box lunch from the little shop at the train station. We talk for a
while, and Oshima urges half his sandwiches on me.
"I made extra today, just for you," he insists. "Don't take it the wrong way, but
you look like you're not eating."
"I'm trying to make my stomach shrink," I explain.
"On purpose?" he asks.
I nod.
"You're doing that to save money?"
Again I nod.
"I can understand that, but at your age you need to eat, and fill up whenever you
get the chance. You need your nutrition."
The sandwich he's offering me looks delicious. I thank him and start eating.
Smoked salmon, watercress, and lettuce on soft white bread. The crust is nicely crunchy,
and horseradish and butter complete the sandwich.
"Did you make this yourself?" I ask.
"No one's about to make it for me," he says.
He pours black coffee from his thermos into a mug, while I drink milk from a
little carton.
"What are you reading these days?"
"Natsume Soseki's complete works," I say. "I still haven't read some of his novels,
so this is a great chance to read them all."
"You like him enough to want to read everything he wrote?" Oshima asks.
I nod.
Steam's rising from the cup in his hand. It's dark and cloudy outside, but at least
the rain's stopped.
"Which of his novels have you read since you came here?"
"I finished The Miner, and now I'm on Poppies."
"The Miner, huh?" Oshima says, apparently searching out a vague memory of the
book. "That's the story of a college student from Tokyo who winds up working in a mine,
right? And he goes through all these tough times with the other miners and finally
returns to the world outside? A sort of medium-length novel, as I recall. I read it a long
time ago. The plot isn't what you normally expect from Soseki, and the style's kind of
unpolished, too. Not one of his best. What do you like about it?"
I try putting into words my impressions of the novel, but I need Crow's help--
need him to show up from wherever he is, spread his wings wide, and search out the
right words for me.
"The main character's from a rich family," I say, "but he has an affair that goes
sour and he gets depressed and runs away from home. While he's sort of wandering
around, this shady character comes up to him and asks him to work in a mine, and he
just tags along after him and finds himself working in the Ashio Mine. He's way down
underground, going through all kinds of experiences he never could have imagined. This
innocent rich boy finds himself crawling around in the dregs of society."
I sip my milk and try to piece together the rest of what I want to say. It takes a
while before Crow comes back, but Oshima waits patiently.
"Those are life-and-death-type experiences he goes through in the mines.
Eventually he gets out and goes back to his old life. But nothing in the novel shows he
learned anything from these experiences, that his life changed, that he thought deeply
now about the meaning of life or started questioning society or anything. You don't get
any sense, either, that he's matured. You have a strange feeling after you finish the book.
It's like you wonder what Soseki was trying to say. It's like not really knowing what he's
getting at is the part that stays with you. I can't explain it very well."
"So The Miner's structured very differently from, say, Soseki's Sanshiro, your
typical modern bildungsroman?"
I nod. "I don't know about that, but you might be right. Sanshiro grows up in the
story. Runs into obstacles, ponders things, overcomes difficulties, right? But the hero of
The Miner's different. All he does is watch things happen and accept it all. I mean,
occasionally he gives his own opinions, but nothing very deep. Instead, he just broods
over his love affair. He comes out of the mine about the same as when he went in. He
has no sense that it was something he decided to do himself, or that he had a choice.
He's like totally passive. But I think in real life people are like that. It's not so easy to
make choices on your own."
"Do you see yourself as sort of like the hero of The Miner?"
I shake my head. "No, I never thought of it that way."
"But people need to cling to something," Oshima says. "They have to. You're
doing the same, even though you don't realize it. It's like Goethe said: Everything's a
metaphor."
I mull this over for a while.
Oshima takes a sip of coffee. "At any rate, that's an interesting take on The Miner.
Especially since you're both runaways. Makes me want to read it again."
I finish the sandwich, crush the now empty milk carton, and toss it in the waste
can. "Oshima," I say, deciding to come right out with it, "I'm sort of in a fix and you're
the only one I can ask for advice."
He opens both hands wide with a go-right-ahead gesture.
"It's a long story, but I don't have anywhere to stay tonight. I've got a sleeping bag,
so I don't need a futon or bed or anything. Just a roof over my head. Do you know of any
place around here like that?"
"I'm guessing that you're not thinking of a hotel or inn?"
I shook my head. "Money's a factor. But I'm also hoping not to be too
conspicuous."
"To the juvenile section of the police, I bet."
"Yeah."
Oshima thinks it over for a time and says, "Well, you could stay here."
"In the library?"
"Sure. It has a roof, and a vacant room, too, that nobody uses at night."
"But do you think it's all right?"
"Of course we'll have to make some arrangements first. But it is possible. Or not
impossible, I should say. I'm sure I can manage it."
"How so?"
"You like to read good books, to figure things out on your own. You look like
you're in good shape physically, and you're an independent kind of guy. You like to lead
a well-regulated life and have a lot of willpower. I mean, even the willpower to make
your stomach smaller, right? I'll talk with Miss Saeki about you becoming my assistant
and staying in the empty room here at the library."
"You want me to be your assistant?"
"You won't have to do much," Oshima says. "Basically help me open and close
the place. We hire professionals to do the heavy cleaning or to input things on the
computer. Apart from this, there's not a whole lot to do. You can just read whatever you
like. Sound good?"
"Yeah, of course it does...." I'm not sure what to say. "But I don't think Miss
Saeki's going to go for it. I'm only fifteen, and a runaway she doesn't know anything
about."
"But Miss Saeki's... how should I put it?" Oshima begins, then
uncharacteristically comes to a halt, searching for the right word. "A little different."
"Different?"
"She has a different take on things than other people."
I nod. A different take on things? What does that mean? "You mean she's an
unusual person?"
Oshima shakes his head. "No, I wouldn't say that. If you're talking about unusual,
that would be me. She just isn't bound by conventional ways of doing things."
I'm still trying to figure out the difference between different and unusual, but
decide to hold off on any more questions. For the time being.
After a pause Oshima says, "Staying here tonight, though, is a problem. So I'll
take you someplace else, where you can stay for a couple of days till we get things
settled. You don't mind, do you? It's a little far away."
"No problem," I tell him.
"The library closes at five," Oshima says, "and I have to straighten things up, so
we'll leave around five-thirty. I'll drive you there in my car. Nobody's staying there now.
And not to worry--the place has a roof."
"I appreciate it."
"You can thank me after we get there. It might not be what you're imagining."
I go back to the reading room and pick up where I left off in Poppies. I'm not a
fast reader. I like to linger over each sentence, enjoying the style. If I don't enjoy the
writing, I stop. Just before five I finish the novel, put it back on the shelf, then sit back
down on the sofa, close my eyes, and think about what happened last night. About
Sakura. About her room. What she did to me. All the twists and turns as events take
their course.
At five-thirty I'm standing outside the library waiting for Oshima. He leads me to
the parking lot out around back and we get into his green sports car. A Mazda Miata
with the top down. My backpack's too big for the little trunk, so we tie it down tight on
the rear rack.
"It's a long drive, so we'll stop along the way for dinner," Oshima says. He turns
the ignition key and starts up the engine.
"Where are we headed?"
"Kochi," he replies. "Ever been there?"
I shake my head. "How far is it?"
"It'll take us about two and a half hours to get where we're going. Toward the
south, over the mountains."
"You don't mind going so far?"
"It's okay. It's a straight shot, and it's still light out. And I've got a full tank."
We drive through the twilit city streets, then get on the highway heading west.
Oshima changes lanes smoothly, slipping in between other cars, effortlessly shifting
gears. Each time the hum of the engine changes slightly. When he shifts gears and floors
it, the little car's soon zipping along at over ninety.
"The car's specially tuned, so it's got a lot of pickup. This isn't your ordinary
Miata. Do you know much about cars?"
I shake my head. Cars are definitely not my specialty. "Do you enjoy driving?" I
ask.
"The doctor made me give up any risky sports. So instead I drive.
Compensation."
"Is something wrong with you?"
"The medical name's kind of long, but it's a type of hemophilia," Oshima says
casually. "Do you know what that is?"
"I think so," I say. I learned about it in biology class. "Once you start bleeding
you can't stop. It's genetic, where the blood doesn't coagulate."
"That's right. There're all kinds of hemophilia, and the type I have is pretty rare.
It's not such a bad type of the disease, but I have to be careful not to get injured. Once I
start bleeding I have to go to the hospital. Besides, these days there're problems with the
blood supply in hospitals. Dying a slow death from AIDS isn't an option for me. So I've
made some connections in town to supply me with safe blood, just in case. Because of
my disease I don't go on trips. Except for regular checkups at the university hospital in
Hiroshima, I hardly ever leave town. It's not so bad, though--I never did like traveling or
sports all that much anyway. I can't use a kitchen knife, so doing any real cooking's out,
which is kind of a shame."
"Driving's a risky enough sport," I tell him.
"It's a different kind of risk. Whenever I drive I try to go as fast as I can. If I'm in
an accident driving fast I won't just wind up getting a cut finger. If you lose a lot of
blood, there's no difference between a hemophiliac and anybody else. It evens things out,
since your chances of survival are the same. You don't have to worry about things like
blood coagulation or anything, and can die without any regrets."
"I see."
"Don't worry," Oshima laughs. "I'm not going have an accident. I'm a careful
driver and don't push it. I keep my car in top condition, too. Besides, when I die I want
to die quietly, all by myself."
"Taking someone else with you, then, isn't an option either."
"You got it."
We pull into a rest stop restaurant for dinner. I have chicken and a salad, he
orders the seafood curry and a salad. Just something to fill our stomachs, is the best you
could say about it. Oshima pays the bill, and we climb into the car again. It's already
gotten dark. He steps on the accelerator and the tachometer shoots way up.
"Do you mind if I put on some music?" Oshima asks.
"Of course not," I reply.
He pushes the CD's play button and some classical piano music starts. I listen for
a while, figuring out the music. I know it's not Beethoven, and not Schumann. Probably
somebody who came in between.
"Schubert?" I ask.
"Good guess," he replies. His hands at ten-and-two on the steering wheel, he
glances over at me. "Do you like Schubert?"
"Not particularly," I tell him.
"When I drive I like to listen to Schubert's piano sonatas with the volume turned
up. Do you know why?"
"I have no idea."
"Because playing Schubert's piano sonatas well is one of the hardest things in the
world. Especially this, the Sonata in D Major. It's a tough piece to master. Some pianists
can play one or maybe two of the movements perfectly, but if you listen to all four
movements as a unified whole, no one has ever nailed it. A lot of famous pianists have
tried to rise to the challenge, but it's like there's always something missing. There's never
one where you can say, Yes! He's got it! Do you know why?"
"No," I reply.
"Because the sonata itself is imperfect. Robert Schumann understood Schubert's
sonatas well, and he labeled this one 'Heavenly Tedious.'"
"If the composition's imperfect, why would so many pianists try to master it?"
"Good question," Oshima says, and pauses as music fills in the silence. "I have no
great explanation for it, but one thing I can say. Works that have a certain imperfection
to them have an appeal for that very reason--or at least they appeal to certain types of
people. Just like you're attracted to Soseki's The Miner. There's something in it that
draws you in, more than more fully realized novels like Kokoro or Sanshiro. You
discover something about that work that tugs at your heart--or maybe we should say the
work discovers you. Schubert's Sonata in D Major is sort of the same thing."
"To get back to the question," I say, "why do you listen to Schubert's sonatas?
Especially when you're driving?"
"If you play Schubert's sonatas, especially this one straight through, it's not art.
Like Schumann pointed out, it's too long and too pastoral, and technically too simplistic.
Play it through the way it is and it's flat and tasteless, some dusty antique. Which is why
every pianist who attempts it adds something of his own, something extra. Like this--
hear how he articulates it there? Adding rubato. Adjusting the pace, modulation,
whatever. Otherwise they can't hold it all together. They have to be careful, though, or
else all those extra devices destroy the dignity of the piece. Then it's not Schubert's
music anymore. Every single pianist who's played this sonata struggles with the same
paradox."
He listens to the music, humming the melody, then continues.
"That's why I like to listen to Schubert while I'm driving. Like I said, it's because
all the performances are imperfect. A dense, artistic kind of imperfection stimulates your
consciousness, keeps you alert. If I listen to some utterly perfect performance of an
utterly perfect piece while I'm driving, I might want to close my eyes and die right then
and there. But listening to the D major, I can feel the limits of what humans are capable
of--that a certain type of perfection can only be realized through a limitless
accumulation of the imperfect. And personally, I find that encouraging. Do you know
what I'm getting at?"
"Sort of...."
"I'm sorry," Oshima says. "I tend to get carried away on the subject."
"But there's all kinds and degrees of imperfection, right?" I say.
"Sure, of course."
"Comparatively speaking, which performance of the D major sonata do you
think's the best?"
"That's a tough one." Oshima gives it some thought. He shifts down, swings over
to the passing lane, swiftly slips pass a huge refrigerated eighteen-wheeler, shifts up, and
steers back into our lane. "Not to frighten you, but a green Miata is one of the hardest
vehicles to spot on the highway at night. It has such a low profile, plus the green tends to
blend into the darkness. Truck drivers especially can't see it from up in their cabs. It can
be a risky business, particularly in tunnels. Sports cars really should be red. Then they'd
stand out. That's why most Ferraris are red. But I happen to like green, even if it makes
things more dangerous. Green's the color of a forest. Red's the color of blood."
He glances at his watch and goes back to humming along with the music.
"Generally I'd have to say Brendel and Ashkenazy give the best performances, though
they don't do anything for me emotionally. Schubert's music challenges and shatters the
ways of the world. That's the essence of Romanticism, and Schubert's music is the
epitome of the Romantic."
I keep on listening to the sonata.
"What do you think? Kind of boring?" he asks.
"Kind of," I admit.
"You can appreciate Schubert if you train yourself. I was the same way when I
first listened to him--it bored me silly. It's only natural for someone your age. In time
you'll appreciate it. People soon get tired of things that aren't boring, but not of what is
boring. Go figure. For me, I might have the leisure to be bored, but not to grow tired of
something. Most people can't distinguish between the two."
"You said you're an unusual person. Do you mean because of the hemophilia?"
"That's part of it," he says, and gives this devilish sort of smile. "There's more to
it than that."
Schubert's long "Heavenly" sonata finishes, and we don't listen to any more music.
We fall silent, each of us filling in the silence with our own random thoughts. I gaze
vacantly at the passing signs. At a junction we turn south and the road heads into the
mountains, one long tunnel after another. Oshima concentrates hard each time he passes
another vehicle. We go by a number of slow-moving trucks on the road, and every time
there's this whooshing moan of air, like somebody's soul is being yanked out.
Occasionally I look back to make sure my backpack's still tied down okay.
"The place we're headed is deep in the mountains, not the most pleasant dwelling
in the world," Oshima says. "I doubt you'll see anybody else while you're there. There's
no radio, TV, or phone. Sure you don't mind?"
"I don't," I reply.
"You're used to being alone," Oshima comments.
I nod.
"But solitude comes in different varieties. What's waiting for you might be a little
unexpected."
"How so?"
Oshima pushes up the bridge of his glasses. "I can't really say. It might change,
depending on you."
We get off the highway and start down a small regional roadway. Along a side
road near the exit there's a small town. Oshima stops at a convenience store and buys
almost more groceries than we can carry--vegetables and fruit, crackers, milk and
mineral water, canned goods, bread, pouch-packed instant food, mostly things that don't
require much cooking. I start to take out my wallet, but he shakes his head and pays for
it all.
Back in the sports car, we head down the road. I'm holding the bags that wouldn't
fit into the trunk. Once we leave the little town everything is dark around us. No houses,
and only the occasional car, the road so narrow it's hard for two cars to pass each other.
Oshima flips on the high beams and races ahead, braking, accelerating, shifting from
second to third and back. His expression is fixed as he focuses on driving, lips tight,
eyes riveted on a point up ahead in the darkness, right hand clutching the top of the
wheel, left hand poised for action on the gearshift knob.
A sharp bluff appears on our left side. It looks like there's a mountain stream
down below. The curves get sharper, the road more slippery, and a couple of times the
rear end of the car spins, but I decide not to worry about it. As far as Oshima is
concerned, having an accident here most likely isn't an option.
My watch shows a little before nine. I crack open my window and let the cold air
rush in. Everything sounds different here. We're in the mountains, heading in deeper. I
breathe a sigh of relief when the road finally cuts away from the bluffs and turns into a
forest. Trees magically soar above us. Our headlights lick at the trunks, illuminating one
after another. We've left the paved road behind, the tires squirting out pebbles that
ricochet against the bottom of the car. The suspension dances up and down over the
rough road. There's no moon out, no stars. A fine rain occasionally splashes against the
windshield.
"Do you come here a lot?" I ask.
"I used to. Now, with the job and all I can't come so often. My older brother's a
surfer and lives on the shore in Kochi. He runs a surf shop there and makes surfboards.
He comes here sometimes. Do you surf?"
"Never tried it," I tell him.
"If you have the chance, you should have my brother teach you. He's very good,"
Oshima says. "If you meet him you'll see he's not at all like me. He's big, tan, kind of
quiet, not so sociable, and likes beer. And wouldn't know Schubert from Wagner. But
we get along really well."
We continue down the road through thick woods, and finally turn off. Oshima
stops the car and, leaving the engine running, climbs out and unlocks a kind of wire
fence and pushes it open. We drive inside and proceed down another windy, bumpy road
into a clearing where the road ends. Oshima stops the car, sighs heavily, and brushes his
hair back with both hands, then kills the engine and sets the parking brake.
The fan still hums, cooling off the overheated engine as steam rises from the hood,
but with the engine off a heavy stillness falls over us. I hear a small stream nearby, the
faint sound of water. High above us the wind rustles symbolically. I open the door and
step outside. Patches of chill hang in the air. I have on a yacht jacket over my T-shirt
and zip it up to my neck.
There's a small building in front of us, a log cabin by the look of it, though it's too
dark to see much. Just a dark outline floating against the background of the forest. The
headlights still on, Oshima slowly approaches the cabin, flashlight in hand, walks up the
porch steps, takes out a key, and unlocks the door. He goes inside, strikes a match, and
lights a lamp. He then steps out onto the porch, holding the lamp, and announces,
"Welcome to my house." It all looks like a drawing in an old storybook.
I walk up the steps and go inside. Oshima lights a larger lamp suspended from the
ceiling. The cabin consists of a single big, boxy room. There's a small bed in the corner,
a dining table and two wooden chairs, an old sofa, a hopelessly faded rug--a bunch of
old furniture nobody wanted, it looks like, just thrown together. There's a cinder block
and board shelf crammed full of books, their covers worn like they've been read a lot.
There's also an old chest for storing clothes. And a simple kitchen with a counter, a
small gas stove, and a sink but no running water. Instead, an aluminum pail I guess is for
water. A pan and kettle on a shelf, plus a frying pan hanging from the wall. And in the
middle of the room there's a black wood-burning stove.
"My brother built this cabin almost all by himself. He took the original rough
lumberjack hut and remodeled it completely. He's good with his hands. I was still pretty
little then and helped out a bit, making sure I didn't get cut or anything. It's pretty
primitive. No electricity. No running water. No toilet. The only modern convenience is
the propane gas." Oshima pours some mineral water into the kettle and sets it to boil.
"My grandfather originally owned this mountain. He was a pretty wealthy man in
Kochi, with a lot of property. He passed away ten years ago, and my brother and I
inherited almost the entire mountain. No other relatives wanted it. It's too far off the
beaten track, and not worth much. If you were going to maintain it for harvesting trees,
you'd have to hire people and it'd cost too much."
I open the curtain at the window. All I can see is a wall of total darkness.
"When I was just about your age," Oshima says, dipping chamomile tea bags into
a pot, "I used to come here a lot and live on my own. Not see anybody else, not talk to
anybody. My brother almost forced me to. Usually, with somebody who has a disease
like mine, you wouldn't do that--too dangerous for them to be alone in some isolated
spot. But my brother didn't mind." He leans back against the counter, waiting for the
water to boil. "He wasn't trying to discipline me or anything, it's just what he believed I
needed. Looking back on it, I can see it was a good experience, something I did need. I
could read a lot, think things over. To tell the truth, after a certain period I hardly went
to school. School and I had sort of a mutual hate relationship going. I was different from
everybody else. Out of the kindness of their hearts they let me graduate from junior high,
but after that I was on my own, basically. Just like you. Did I already tell you all this?"
I shake my head. "Is that why you're being so nice to me?"
"That's part of it," he says, then pauses. "But that's not the whole reason."
Oshima passes me a cup of tea and sips at his own. My nerves are tense after the
long drive, and the chamomile is just what I need to calm down.
Oshima glances at his watch. "I'd better be going, so let me explain everything.
There's a nice stream nearby you can use for water. It's spring fed so you can drink it as
is. Much better than these bottles of mineral water. There's firewood stacked up in back
so use the stove if you get cold. It gets pretty chilly here. I've even used it a few times in
August. You can use the stove for simple cooking. If you need any other tools or
anything, check the toolshed out back. And feel free to wear any old clothes of my
brother's you find in the dresser. He doesn't care if somebody wears his things."
Oshima rests his hands on his hips and gives the cabin a once-over. "It's not some
romantic getaway, that's for sure. But for simple living, it'll do. One thing I've got to
warn you about--don't go very far into the woods. The forest is really dense, and there's
not a good path through it. Always keep the cabin in sight. It's easy to get lost if you go
any farther, and it's hard to find your way back. I had a terrible experience there once. I
was only a couple hundred yards from here but spent half the day going in circles. You
might think Japan's a small country, that there's no chance you could get lost in a forest.
But once you get lost in these woods, believe me, you stay lost."
I file that away for future reference.
"And except for an emergency, I wouldn't come down off the mountain. It's too
far to any other houses. Just wait here, and I'll be back in a couple of days to pick you up.
You have enough food to see you through. By the way, do you have a cell phone?"
"I do," I tell him, pointing at my backpack.
He grins at me. "Keep it in your pack. It won't work here--you're out of range.
And of course a radio won't work either. You're cut off from the world. You should be
able to get a lot of reading done."
I suddenly think of a very practical question. "If there's no toilet, where should I
go to the bathroom?"
Oshima spreads both hands wide. "The forest is all yours. It's up to you."
Chapter 14
Nakata visited the vacant lot for several days. One morning it rained heavily, so he spent
the day doing simple woodworking in his room, but apart from that he spent his time
seated in the weeds waiting for the missing tortoiseshell cat to show up, or the man in
the strange hat. But no luck.
At the end of each day Nakata stopped by the home of the people who'd hired him
and gave an update on his search--where he'd gone, what sort of information he'd
managed to pick up. The cat's owner would pay him twenty dollars, his going rate.
Nobody had ever officially set that fee, word just got around that there was a master catfinder
in the neighborhood and somehow he settled on that daily rate. People would
always give him something extra besides the money, too--food, occasionally clothes.
And a bonus of eighty dollars once he actually tracked down the missing cat.
Nakata wasn't constantly being asked to search for missing cats, so the fees he
accumulated each month didn't add up to much. The older of his younger brothers paid
his utilities out of the inheritance Nakata's parents had left him--which wasn't very much
to begin with--and he lived on his meager savings and a municipal monthly subsidy for
the elderly handicapped. He managed to get by on the subsidy alone, so he could spend
his cat-finding fees as he wished, and for him it seemed like a substantial amount.
Sometimes, though, he couldn't come up with any idea of how to spend it, other than
enjoying his favorite grilled eel. Going to the bank or having a savings account at the
post office involved filling out forms, so any leftover money he hid beneath the tatami in
his room.
Being able to converse with cats was Nakata's little secret. Only he and the cats
knew about it. People would think he was crazy if he mentioned it, so he never did.
Everybody knew he wasn't very bright, but being dumb and being crazy were different
matters altogether.
Sometimes people would walk by when he was deep in conversation with a cat,
but they never seemed to care. It wasn't so unusual, after all, to see old folks talking to
animals as if they were people. But if anyone did happen to comment on his abilities
with cats and say something like, "Mr. Nakata, how are you able to know cats' habits so
well? It's almost like you can talk with them," he'd just smile and let it pass. Nakata was
always serious and well mannered, with a pleasant smile, and was a favorite among the
housewives in the neighborhood. His neat appearance also helped. Poor though he was,
Nakata enjoyed bathing and doing laundry, and the nearly brand-new clothes his clients
often gave him only added to his clean-cut look. Some of the clothes--a salmon pink
Jack Nicklaus golf shirt, for instance--didn't exactly suit him, but Nakata didn't mind as
long as they were neat and clean.
Nakata was standing at the front door, giving a halting report to his present client,
Mrs. Koizumi, on the search for her cat, Goma.
"Nakata finally got some information about little Goma," he began. "A person
named Kawamura said that a few days ago he saw a cat resembling Goma over in the
empty lot, the one with the wall around it, over in the 2-chome District. It's two big
roads away from here, and he said the age, coat, and collar are all the same as Goma's.
Nakata decided to keep a lookout at the empty lot, so I take a lunch and sit there every
day, morning till sunset. No, don't worry about that--I have plenty of free time, so unless
it's raining hard I don't mind at all. But if you think it's no longer necessary, ma'am, for
me to be on the lookout, then please tell me. I will stop right away."
He didn't tell her that this Mr. Kawamura wasn't a person but a striped brown cat.
That, he figured, would only complicate matters.
Mrs. Koizumi thanked him. Her two little daughters were in a gloomy mood after
their beloved pet suddenly vanished, and had lost their appetite. Their mother couldn't
just explain it away by telling them that cats tended to disappear every once in a while.
But despite the shock to the girls, she didn't have the time to go around town looking for
their cat. That made her all the more glad to find a person like Nakata who, for a mere
twenty dollars per diem, would do his best to search for Goma. Nakata was a strange old
man, and had a weird way of speaking, but people claimed he was an absolute genius
when it came to locating cats. She knew she shouldn't think about it like this, but the old
man didn't seem bright enough to deceive anyone. She handed him his fee in an
envelope, as well as a Tupperware container with some vegetable rice and taro potatoes
she'd just cooked.
Nakata bowed as he took the Tupperware, sniffed the food, and thanked her.
"Thank you kindly. Taro is one of Nakata's favorites."
"I hope you enjoy it," Mrs. Koizumi replied.
A week had passed since he first staked out the empty lot, during which time
Nakata had seen a lot of different cats come in and out. Kawamura, the striped brown
cat, stopped by a couple of times each day to say hello. Nakata greeted him, and chatted
about the weather and his sub city. He still couldn't follow a word the cat said.
"Crouch on pavement, Kawara's in trouble," Kawamura said. He seemed to want
to convey something to Nakata, but the old man didn't have a clue and he said so.
The cat seemed perplexed by this, and repeated the same--possibly the same--
thought in different words. "Kawara's shouting tied." Nakata was even more lost.
Too bad Mimi's not here to help out, he thought. Mimi'd give the cat a good slap
on the cheek and get him to make some sense. A smart cat, that Mimi. But Mimi never
showed up in a field like this, since she hated getting fleas from other cats.
Once he'd spilled out all these ideas Nakata couldn't follow, Kawamura left
beaming.
Other cats filtered in and out. At first they were on their guard when they spotted
Nakata, gazing at him from a distance in annoyance, but after they saw that he was
simply sitting there, doing nothing, they forgot all about him. In his typical friendly way,
Nakata tried to strike up conversations. He'd say hello and introduce himself, but most
of the cats turned a deaf ear, pretending they couldn't hear him, or stare right through
him. The cats here were particularly adept at giving someone the cold shoulder. They
must have had some pretty awful experiences with humans, Nakata decided. He was in
no position to demand anything of them, and didn't blame them for their coldness. He
knew very well that in the world of cats he would always be an outsider.
"So you can talk, huh?" the cat, a black-and-white tabby with torn ears, said a bit
hesitantly as it glanced around. The cat spoke gruffly but seemed nice enough.
"Yes, a little," Nakata replied.
"Impressive all the same," the tabby commented.
"My name's Nakata," Nakata said, introducing himself. "And your name would
be?"
"Ain't got one," the tabby said brusquely.
"How about Okawa? Do you mind if I call you that?"
"Whatever."
"Well, then, Mr. Okawa," Nakata said, "as a token of our meeting each other,
would you care for some dried sardines?"
"Sounds good. One of my favorites, sardines."
Nakata took a saran-wrapped sardine from his bag and opened it up for Okawa.
He always had a few sardines with him, just in case. Okawa gobbled down the sardine,
stripping it from head to tail, then cleaned his face.
"That hit the spot. Much obliged. I'd be happy to lick you somewhere, if you'd
like."
"No, there's no need to. Nakata's grateful for the offer, but right now I don't need
to be licked anywhere, thanks all the same. Actually, I've been asked by its owner to
locate a missing cat. A female tortoiseshell by the name of Goma." Nakata took the
color snapshot of Goma out of his bag and showed it to Okawa. "Someone told me this
cat has been spotted in this vacant lot. So Nakata's been sitting here for several days
waiting for Goma to show up. I was wondering if, by chance, you may have run across
her."
Okawa glanced at the photo and made a gloomy face. Frown lines appeared
between his eyebrows and he blinked in consternation several times. "I'm grateful for
the sardine, don't get me wrong. But I can't talk about that. I'll be in hot water if I do."
Nakata was bewildered. "In hot water if you talk about it?"
"A dangerous, nasty business, it is. I think you'd better write that cat off. And if
you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from this place. I don't want you to get
in trouble. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but just consider this warning my way of
thanking you for the food." With this Okawa stood up, looked around, and disappeared
into a thicket.
Nakata sighed, took out his thermos, and slowly sipped some tea. Okawa had said
it was dangerous to be here, but Nakata couldn't imagine how. All he was doing was
looking for a lost little cat. What could possibly be dangerous about that? Maybe it was
that cat-catcher with the strange hat Kawamura told him about who's dangerous. But
Nakata was a person, not a cat. So why should he be afraid of a cat-catcher?
But the world was full of many things Nakata couldn't hope to fathom, so he gave
up thinking about it. With a brain like his, the only result he got from thinking too much
was a headache. Nakata sipped the last drop of his tea, screwed the cap on the thermos,
and placed it back inside his bag.
After Okawa disappeared into the thicket, no other cats showed up for a long time.
Just butterflies, silently fluttering above the weeds. A flock of sparrows flew into the lot,
scattered in various directions, regrouped, and winged away. Nakata dozed off a few
times, coming awake with a start. He knew approximately what time it was by the
position of the sun.
It was nearly evening when the dog showed up in front of him.
A huge, black dog suddenly appeared from out of the thicket, silently lumbering
forward. From where Nakata sat, the beast looked more like a calf than a dog. It had
long legs, short hair, bulging, steely muscles, ears as sharp as knife points, and no collar.
Nakata didn't know much about breeds of dogs, but one glance told him this was the
vicious variety, or at least one that could turn mean if it had to. The kind of dog the
military used in its K-9 corps.
The dog's eyes were totally expressionless and the skin around its mouth turned
up, exposing wicked-looking fangs. Its teeth had blood stuck to them, and slimy bits of
meat matted around its mouth. Its bright red tongue flicked out between its teeth like a
flame. The dog fixed its glare on Nakata and stood there, unmoving, without a sound,
for a long time. Nakata was silent too. He didn't know how to speak to dogs--only cats.
The dog's eyes were as glazed and lifeless as glass beads congealed from swamp water.
Nakata breathed quietly, shallowly, but he wasn't afraid. He had a pretty good
idea he was face-to-face with a hostile, aggressive animal. (Why this was, he had no
idea.) But he didn't carry this thought one step further and see himself in imminent peril.
The concept of death was beyond his powers of imagination. And pain was something
he wasn't aware of until he actually felt it. As an abstract concept pain didn't mean a
thing. The upshot of this was he wasn't afraid, even with this monstrous dog staring him
down. He was merely perplexed.
Stand up! the dog said.
Nakata gulped. The dog was talking! Not really talking, since its mouth wasn't
moving--but communicating through some means other than speech.
Stand up and follow me! the dog commanded.
Nakata did as he was told, clambering to his feet. He considered saying hello to
the dog, then thought better of it. Even if they were able to converse, he didn't think it
would be of much use. Besides, he didn't feel like talking with the dog, much less giving
it a name. No amount of time would turn it into a friend.
A thought crossed Nakata's mind: Maybe this dog has some connection with the
Governor, who found out he was getting money for finding cats and was going to take
away his sub city! Wouldn't surprise me at all, he thought, if the Governor had this K-9
kind of dog. And if that's what's going on, I'm in big trouble!
Once Nakata got to his feet, the dog slowly started to walk away. Nakata
shouldered his bag and set off after him. The dog had a short tail and, below its base,
two large balls.
The dog cut straight across the vacant lot and slipped out between the wooden
fence. Nakata followed, and the dog never looked back. No doubt he could tell by the
sound of his footsteps that Nakata was behind him. As they drew closer to the shopping
district the streets grew more crowded, mostly with housewives out shopping. Eyes
fixed straight ahead, the dog walked on, his whole bearing overpowering. When people
spied this giant, violent-looking beast, they leaped aside, a couple of bicyclists even
getting off and crossing over to the other side of the street to avoid facing him.
Walking behind this monstrous dog made Nakata feel that people were getting
out of his way. Maybe they thought he was walking the dog, minus a leash. And indeed
some people shot him reproachful looks. This made him sad. I'm not doing this because
I want to, he wanted to explain to them. Nakata's being led by this dog, he wanted to say.
Nakata's not a strong person, but a weak one.
He followed the dog quite a distance. They passed a number of intersections and
emerged from the shopping district. The dog ignored traffic signals at crosswalks. The
roads weren't so wide, and the cars weren't going fast, so it wasn't all that dangerous to
cross on red. The drivers slammed on their brakes when they saw this huge animal in
front of them. For his part, the dog bared his fangs, glared at the drivers, and sauntered
defiantly across the street. The dog knew full well what the traffic lights meant, Nakata
could sense, but was willfully ignoring them. This dog was used to getting his way.
Nakata no longer knew where they were. At one point they passed a residential
area in Nakano Ward he was familiar with, but then they turned a corner and he was no
longer in familiar territory. Nakata felt anxious. What was he going to do if he got lost
and couldn't find his way back? For all he knew they might not even be in Nakano Ward
anymore. He craned his neck, trying to spot familiar landmarks, but no such luck. This
was a part of the city he'd never seen before.
Unconcerned, the dog kept walking, keeping a pace he knew Nakata could keep
up with, head up, ears perked, balls swaying like a pendulum.
"Say, is this still Nakano Ward?" Nakata called out.
The dog didn't respond or look around.
"Do you work for the Governor?"
Again no response.
"Nakata's just looking for a lost cat. A small tortoiseshell cat named Goma."
Nothing.
This was getting him nowhere, and he gave up.
They came to a corner in a quiet residential area with big houses but no passersby,
and the dog boldly strode through an open old-fashioned double gate set into an oldstyle
stone wall surrounding one of the houses. A large car was parked in a carport--big
and black just like the dog, and shiny. The front door of the house was open as well. The
dog went right inside, without hesitating. Before stepping into the house, Nakata took
off his old sneakers and lined them up neatly at the entrance, stuffed his hiking hat
inside his bag, and brushed grass blades off his trousers. The dog stood there, waiting
for Nakata to make himself presentable, then went down the polished wooden corridor,
leading him to what looked like either a sitting room or a library.
The room was dark. The sun had almost set and the heavy curtain at the window
facing the garden was drawn. No lights were on. Farther back in the room was a large
desk, and it looked like someone was sitting beside it. Nakata knew he'd have to wait
until his eyes adjusted to say for sure. A black silhouette floated there indistinctly, like a
paper cutout. As Nakata entered the room the silhouette slowly turned. Whoever was
there sat in a swivel chair and had turned around to face him. His duty done, the dog
came to a halt, plopped down on the floor, and closed his eyes.
"Hello," Nakata said to the dark outline.
The other person didn't say a thing.
"Sorry to bother you, but my name is Nakata. I'm not an intruder."
No reply.
"This dog told me to follow him, so here I am. Excuse me, but the dog just went
right into your house and I came after him. If you don't mind terribly, I'll be leaving...."
"Take a seat on the sofa, if you would," the man said in a soft but strong tone.
"All right, I'll do that," Nakata said, lowering himself onto the one-person sofa.
Right next to him, the dog was still as a statue. "Are you... the Governor?"
"Something like that," the man said from the darkness. "If that makes it easier for
you, then go ahead and think that. It doesn't matter."
The man turned around and tugged at a chain to turn on a floor lamp. A yellow,
antiquish light snapped on, faint but sufficient for the room.
The man before him was tall, thin, and wearing a black silk hat. He was seated on
a leather swivel chair, his legs crossed in front of him. He had on a form-fitting red coat
with long tails, a black vest, and long black boots. His trousers were as white as snow
and fit him perfectly. One hand was raised to the brim of his hat, like he was tipping it
politely to a lady. His left hand gripped a black walking stick by the round, gold knob.
Looking at the hat, Nakata suddenly thought: This must be the cat-catcher!
The man's features weren't as unusual as his clothes. He was somewhere between
young and old, handsome and ugly. His eyebrows were sharp and thick, and his cheeks
had a healthy glow. His face was terribly smooth, with no whiskers at all. Below
narrowed eyes, a cold smile played at his lips. The kind of face it was hard to remember,
especially since it was his unusual clothes that caught the eye. Put another set of clothes
on him and you might not even recognize the man.
"You know who I am, I assume?"
"No, sir, I'm afraid I don't," Nakata said.
The man looked a bit let down by this. "Are you sure?"
"Yes, I am. I forgot to mention it, but Nakata isn't very bright."
"You've never seen me before?" the man said, rising from the chair to stand
sideways to Nakata, a leg raised as if he were walking. "Doesn't ring a bell?"
"No, I'm sorry. I don't recognize you."
"I see. Perhaps you're not a whisky drinker, then," the man said.
"That's right. Nakata doesn't drink or smoke. I'm poor enough to get a sub city so
I can't afford that."
The man sat back down and crossed his legs. He picked up a glass on the desk
and took a sip of whisky. Ice cubes clinked in the glass. "I hope you don't mind if I
indulge?"
"No, I don't mind. Please feel free."
"Thank you," the man said, gazing intently at Nakata. "So you really don't know
who I am."
"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't."
The man's lips twisted slightly. For a brief moment a cold smile rose like a
distorted ripple on the surface of water, vanished, then rose up again. "Anyone who
enjoys whisky would recognize me right away, but never mind. My name is Johnnie
Walker. Johnnie Walker. Most everyone knows who I am. Not to boast, but I'm famous
all over the world. An iconic figure, you might say. I'm not the real Johnnie Walker,
mind you. I have nothing to do with the British distilling company. I've just borrowed
his appearance and name. A person's got to have an appearance and name, am I right?"
Silence descended on the room. Nakata had no idea what the man was talking
about, though he did catch the name Johnnie Walker. "Are you a foreigner, Mr. Johnnie
Walker?"
Johnnie Walker inclined his head. "Well, if that helps you understand me, feel
free to think so. Or not. Because both are true."
Nakata was lost. He might as well be talking with Kawamura, the cat. "So you're
a foreigner, but also not a foreigner. Is that what you mean?"
"That is correct."
Nakata didn't pursue the point. "Did you have this dog bring me here, then?"
"I did," Johnnie Walker replied simply.
"Which means... that maybe you have something you'd like to ask me?"
"It's more like you have something to ask me," Johnnie Walker replied, then took
another sip of his whisky. "As I understand it, you've been waiting in that vacant lot for
several days for me to show up."
"Yes, that's right. I completely forgot! Nakata's not too bright, and I forget things
quickly. It's just like you said. I've been waiting for you in that vacant lot to ask you
about a missing cat."
Johnnie Walker tapped his black walking stick smartly against the side of his
black boots, and the dry click filled the room. The black dog's ears twitched. "The sun's
setting, the tide's going out. So why don't we cut to the chase," Johnnie Walker said.
"You wanted to see me because of this cat?"
"Yes, that's correct. Mrs. Koizumi asked Nakata to find her, and I've been looking
all over for Goma for the past ten days or so. Do you know Goma?"
"I know her very well."
"And do you know where she might be?"
"I do indeed."
Lips slightly parted, Nakata stared at the silk hat, then back at his face. Johnnie
Walker's thin lips were tightly closed, with a confident look.
"Is she nearby?"
Johnnie Walker nodded a few times. "Yes, very near."
Nakata gazed around the room, but couldn't see any cats. Only the writing desk,
the swivel chair the man was seated on, the sofa he himself was on, two more chairs, the
floor lamp, and a coffee table. "So can I take Goma home?" Nakata asked.
"That all depends on you."
"On Nakata?"
"Correct. It's all up to you," Johnnie Walker said, one eyebrow raised slightly. "If
you make up your mind to do it, you can take Goma back home. And make Mrs.
Koizumi and her daughters happy. Or you can never take her back, and break their
hearts. You wouldn't want to do that, I imagine?"
"No, Nakata doesn't want to disappoint them."
"The same with me. I don't want to disappoint them either."
"So what should I do?"
Johnnie Walker twirled the walking stick. "I want you to do something for me."
"Is it something that Nakata can do?"
"I never ask the impossible. That's a colossal waste of time, don't you agree?"
Nakata gave it some thought. "I suppose so."
"Which means that what I'm asking you to do is something you're capable of
doing."
Nakata pondered this. "Yes, I'd say that's true."
"As a rule, there's always counterevidence for every theory."
"Beg pardon?" Nakata said.
"For every theory there has to be counterevidence--otherwise science wouldn't
progress," Johnnie Walker said, defiantly tapping his stick against his boots. The dog
perked up his ears again. "Not at all."
Nakata kept quiet.
"Truth be told, I've been looking for someone like you for a long time," Johnnie
Walker said. "But it wasn't easy to find the right person. The other day, though, I saw
you talking to a cat and it hit me--this is the exact person I've been looking for. That's
why I've had you come all this way. I feel bad about having you go to all the trouble,
though."
"No trouble at all. Nakata has plenty of free time."
"I've prepared a couple of theories about you," Johnnie Walker said. "And of
course several pieces of counterevidence. It's like a game, a mental game I play. But
every game needs a winner and a loser. In this case, winning and losing involves
determining which theory is correct and which theories aren't. But I don't imagine you
understand what I'm talking about."
Silently, Nakata shook his head.
Johnnie Walker tapped his walking stick against his boots twice, a signal for the
dog to stand up.
Chapter 15
Oshima climbs into his Miata and flips on the headlights. As he steps on the gas, pebbles
shoot up, scraping the bottom of the car. He backs up, then turns around to face the road.
He raises his hand in farewell, and I do the same. The brake lights are swallowed up in
darkness, the sound of the engine fading. Then it's completely gone, and the silence of
the forest takes over.
I go back into the cabin and bolt the door shut from the inside. Like it was lying
in wait for me, silence wraps itself around me tightly once I'm alone. The night air's so
cold it's hard to believe it's early summer, but it's too late to light the stove. All I can do
is crawl inside my sleeping bag and get some sleep. My mind's a little spacey from lack
of sleep and my muscles ache from bouncing around in the car so long. I turn down the
light on the lamp. The room dims as the shadows that fill the corners grow more intense.
It's too much trouble to change clothes, so I crawl into my sleeping bag with my jeans
and yacht jacket on.
I close my eyes but can't fall asleep, my body dying for rest while my mind's wide
awake. A bird occasionally breaks the silence of the night. Other sounds filter in too,
things I can't identify. Something trampling on fallen leaves. Something heavy rustling
the branches. The sound of a deep breath. The occasional ominous creak of floorboards
on the porch. They sound like they're right near the cabin, an army of invisible creatures
that populates the darkness and has me surrounded.
And I feel like somebody's watching me. My skin smarts with the sense of eyes
boring in on me. My heart beats out a hollow thump. Several times from inside the
sleeping bag I open my eyes a slit and peer around the dimly lit room just to be sure no
one else is there. The front door's bolted with that heavy bolt, and the thick curtains at
the windows are shut tight. So I'm okay, I tell myself. I'm alone in this room and no
one's gazing in at me through the windows.
But still I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched. My throat's parched and
I'm having trouble breathing. I need to drink some water, but if I do I'll need to take a
leak and that means going outside. I have to hold on till morning. Curled up in my
sleeping bag, I give a small shake of my head.
Are you kidding me? You're like some scared little kid, afraid of the silence and
the dark. You're not going to wimp out on me now, are you? You always thought you
were tough, but when it hits the fan, you look like you're about to burst into tears. Look
at you--I bet you're going to wet your bed!
Ignoring him, I close my eyes tight, zip the bag up to just below my nose, and
clear my head. I don't open my eyes for anything--not when I hear an owl hooting, not
when something lands with a thud on the ground outside. Not even when I sense
something moving inside the cabin. I'm being tested, I tell myself. Oshima spent a few
days alone here too, when he was about my age. He must have been scared out of his
wits, same as me. That's what he meant by solitude comes in different varieties. Oshima
knows exactly how I feel being here alone at night, because he's gone through the same
thing, and felt the same emotions. This thought helps me relax a little. I feel like I can
trace the shadows of the past that linger here and imagine myself as a part of it. I take a
deep breath, and I fall asleep before I know it.
It's after six a. m. when I wake up. The air is filled with a shower of bird calls.
The birds busily flit from branch to branch, calling out to each other in piercing chirps.
Their message has none of the deep echo and hidden implications of those the night
before. When I pull back the curtains, every bit of last night's darkness has disappeared
from around the cabin. Everything sparkles in a newborn golden glow. I light the stove,
boil some mineral water, and make a cup of chamomile tea, then open a box of crackers
and have a few with cheese. After that I brush my teeth at the sink and wash my face.
I pull on a windbreaker over my yacht jacket and go outside. The morning light
pours down through the tall trees onto the open space in front of the cabin, sunbeams
everywhere and mist floating like freshly minted souls. The pure clean air pierces my
lungs with each breath. I sit down on a porch step and watch the birds scudding from
tree to tree, listening to their calls. Most of them move about in pairs, constantly
checking to see where their partner is, screeching out to keep in touch.
I follow the sound of the water and find the stream right away, close by. Rocks
form a kind of pool where the water flows in, swirling around in a maze of eddies before
rushing back out to rejoin the stream. The water is clear and beautiful. I scoop some up
to drink--it's cold and delicious--and then hold my hands in the current.
Back at the cabin I cook ham and eggs in the frying pan, make some toast using a
metal net, and heat milk in a small pan to wash down my meal. After eating I haul a
chair out to the porch, prop my legs up on the railing, and spend the morning reading.
Oshima's bookshelf is crammed full of hundreds of books. Only a few are novels,
chiefly classics. Mostly they're books on philosophy, sociology, history, geography,
natural sciences, economics--a huge number of subjects, a random selection of fields.
Oshima said he'd hardly attended school at all, so this must have been how he got his
education.
I pick out a book on the trial of Adolf Eichmann. I have a vague notion of him as
a Nazi war criminal, but no special interest in the guy. The book just happens to catch
my eye, is all. I start to read and learn how this totally practical lieutenant colonel in the
SS, with his metal-frame glasses and thinning hair, was, soon after the war started,
assigned by Nazi headquarters to design a "final solution" for the Jews--extermination,
that is--and how he investigated the best ways of actually carrying this out. Apparently it
barely crossed his mind to question the morality of what he was doing. All he cared
about was how best, in the shortest period of time and for the lowest possible cost, to
dispose of the Jews. And we're talking about eleven million Jews he figured needed to
be eliminated in Europe.
Eichmann studied how many Jews could be packed into each railroad car, what
percentage would die of "natural" causes while being transported, the minimal number
of people needed to keep this operation going. The cheapest method of disposing of the
dead bodies--burning, or burying, or dissolving them. Seated at his desk Eichmann
pored over all these numbers. Once he put it into operation, everything went pretty much
according to plan. By the end of the war some six million Jews had been disposed of.
Strangely, the guy never felt any remorse. Sitting in court in Tel Aviv, behind
bulletproof glass, Eichmann looked like he couldn't for the life of him figure out why he
was being tried, or why the eyes of the world were upon him. He was just a technician,
he insisted, who'd found the most efficient solution to the problem assigned him. Wasn't
he doing just what any good bureaucrat would do? So why was he being singled out and
accused?
Sitting in the quiet woods with birds chirping all around me, I read the story of
this practical guy. In the back of the book there's a penciled note Oshima had written.
His handwriting's pretty easy to spot: It's all a question of imagination. Our
responsibility begins with the power to imagine. It's just like Yeats said: In dreams begin
responsibilities. Flip this around and you could say that where there's no power to
imagine, no responsibility can arise. Just like we see with Eichmann.
I try to picture Oshima sitting in this chair, his usual nicely sharpened pencil in
hand, looking back over this book and writing down his impressions. In dreams begin
responsibilities. The words hit home.
I shut the book, lay it on my lap, and think about my own responsibility. I can't
help it. My white T-shirt was soaked in fresh blood. I washed the blood away with these
hands, so much blood the sink turned red. I imagine I'll be held responsible for all that
blood. I try to picture myself being tried in a court, my accusers doggedly trying to pin
the blame on me, angrily pointing fingers and glaring at me. I insist that you can't be
held responsible for something you can't remember. I don't have any idea what really
took place, I tell them. But they counter with this: "It doesn't matter whose dream it
started out as, you have the same dream. So you're responsible for whatever happens in
the dream. That dream crept inside you, right down the dark corridor of your soul."
Just like Adolf Eichmann, caught up--whether he liked it or not--in the twisted
dreams of a man named Hitler.
I put the book down, stand up, and stretch. I have been reading for a long time
and need to get up and move around a little. I take the aluminum pail by the sink and go
to the stream to fill it. Next I take an armload of firewood from the shed in back and set
it by the stove.
In a corner of the porch there's a faded nylon rope for hanging out laundry. I pull
out my damp clothes from my backpack, smooth out all the wrinkles, and hang them up
to dry. I take everything else out of the pack and lay it out on the bed, then sit down at
the desk and fill in my diary for the last few days. I use a pen with a fine tip and write
down in small letters everything that's happened to me. I don't know how long I'll
remember all the details, so I better get them down as fast as I can. I search my memory.
How I lost consciousness and came to in the woods behind a shrine. The darkness and
my blood-soaked shirt. Phoning Sakura, spending the night at her place. How we talked,
how she did that to me.
She'd said, I don't get it, you don't have to tell me that! Why don't you just go
ahead and imagine what you want? You don't need my permission. How can I know
what's in your head?
But she got it wrong. What I imagine is perhaps very important. For the entire
world.
That afternoon I decide to go into the woods. Oshima said that going too far into
the forest is dangerous. Always keep the cabin in sight, he warned me. But I'll probably
be here for a few days, and I should know something about this massive wall of a forest
that surrounds me. Better to know a little, I figure, than nothing at all. Empty-handed, I
say good-bye to the sunny lot and step into the gloomy sea of trees.
There's a kind of rough path trod down through the forest, mostly following the
lay of the land, but improved here and there with a few flat rocks laid down like
stepping stones. Places prone to erosion have been neatly buttressed with wooden planks,
so that even if the weeds grow over it you can still follow the path. Maybe Oshima's
brother worked on the path little by little each time he stayed here. I follow it into the
woods, uphill at first, then it goes down and skirts around a high boulder before
climbing up again. Overall it's mostly uphill, but not a very tough climb. Tall trees line
both sides, with dull-colored trunks, thick branches growing out every which way, dense
leaves overhead. The ground is covered with undergrowth and ferns that have managed
to soak up as much of the faint light as they can. In places where the sun doesn't reach,
moss has silently covered the rocks.
Like someone excitedly relating a story only to find the words petering out, the
path gets narrower the farther I go, the undergrowth taking over. Beyond a certain point
it's hard to tell if it's really a path or something that just vaguely resembles one.
Eventually it's completely swallowed up in a sea of ferns. Maybe the path does continue
up ahead, but I decide to save that exploration for next time. I don't have on the right
kind of clothes and haven't really prepared for that.
I come to a halt and turn around. Suddenly nothing looks familiar, there's nothing
I can cling to. A tangle of tree trunks ominously blocks the view. It's dim, the air filled
with a stagnant green, and not a bird to be heard.
I'm suddenly covered in goosebumps, but there's nothing to worry about, I tell
myself. The path is right over there. As long as I don't lose sight of that I'll be able to
return to the light. Eyes glued to the ground, I carefully retrace my steps and, after much
longer than it took me to get here, finally arrive back in front of the cabin. The lot is
filled with bright, early-summer sunlight, and the clear calls of birds echo as they search
for food. Everything's exactly the same as I left it. Or at least I think it is. The chair I
was sitting on is still on the porch. The book I was reading is facedown like I left it.
Now I know exactly how dangerous the forest can be. And I hope I never forget it.
Just like Crow said, the world's filled with things I don't know about. All the plants and
trees there, for instance. I'd never imagined that trees could be so weird and unearthly. I
mean, the only plants I've ever really seen or touched till now are the city kind--neatly
trimmed and cared-for bushes and trees. But the ones here--the ones living here--are
totally different. They have a physical power, their breath grazing any humans who
might chance by, their gaze zeroing in on the intruder like they've spotted their prey.
Like they have some dark, prehistoric, magical powers. Like deep-sea creatures rule the
ocean depths, in the forest trees reign supreme. If it wanted to, the forest could reject
me--or swallow me up whole. A healthy amount of fear and respect might be a good
idea.
I go back to the cabin, take my compass out of my backpack, and check that the
needle's showing north. It might come in handy sometime, so I slip it in my pocket. I go
sit on the porch, gaze at the woods, and listen to Cream and Duke Ellington on my
Walkman, songs I recorded off a library's collection of CDs. I play "Crossroads" a
couple of times. Music helps me calm down, but I can't listen for very long. There's no
electricity here and no way to recharge the batteries, so once my extra batteries are dead
the music's over for good.
I work out a bit before dinner. Push-ups, sit-ups, squats, handstands, different
kinds of stretching exercises--a routine that keeps you in shape without any machines or
equipment. Kind of boring, I'll admit, but you get a decent workout. A trainer at the gym
taught me the routine. "Prisoners in solitary confinement like this best," he explained,
calling it the "world's loneliest workout routine." I focus on what I'm doing and go
through a couple of sets, my shirt getting sweaty in the process.
After a simple dinner I go out on the porch and gaze up at the stars twinkling
above, the random scattering of millions of stars. Even in a planetarium you wouldn't
find this many. Some of them look really big and distinct, like if you reached your hand
out intently you could touch them. The whole thing is breathtaking.
Not just beautiful, though--the stars are like the trees in the forest, alive and
breathing. And they're watching me. What I've done up till now, what I'm going to do--
they know it all. Nothing gets past their watchful eyes. As I sit there under the shining
night sky, again a violent fear takes hold of me. My heart's pounding a mile a minute,
and I can barely breathe. All these millions of stars looking down on me, and I've never
given them more than a passing thought before. Not just stars--how many other things
haven't I noticed in the world, things I know nothing about? I suddenly feel helpless,
completely powerless. And I know I'll never outrun that awful feeling.
Back inside the cabin, I carefully arrange some firewood in the stove, ball up a
few sheets of an old newspaper, light it, and make sure the wood catches fire. In grade
school I was sent to camp, and learned how to build a fire. I hated camp, but at least one
good thing came out of it, I suppose. I open the damper to let the smoke out. It doesn't
go well at first, but when a piece of kindling catches the fire spreads to the other sticks. I
shut the door on the stove and scrape a chair over in front of it, set a lamp nearby, and
pick up where I'd left off in the book. Once the fire's built up a bit I set a kettle of water
on top to boil, and after a while the kettle burbles pleasantly.
Back to Eichmann. Of course his project didn't always go according to plan.
Conditions at various sites slowed things down. When this happened he acted like a
human being--at least a little. He got angry, is what I'm saying. He grew incensed at
these uncertain elements that threw his elegant solution into disarray. Trains ran late.
Bureaucratic red tape held things up. People in charge were replaced, and relations with
their successors didn't go well. After the collapse of the Russian front, concentration
camp guards were sent there to fight. There were heavy snowfalls. Power outages. Not
enough poison gas to go around. Rail lines were bombed. Eichmann hated the war itself-
-that element of uncertainty that screwed up his plans.
At his trial he described all this, no emotion showing on his face. His recall was
amazing. His life was entirely made up of these details.
At ten I put the book down, brush my teeth, and wash my face. The fire bathes the
room in an orange glow, and the pleasant warmth calms my tension and fear. I snuggle
into my sleeping bag dressed only in a T-shirt and boxers. Compared to last night I'm
able to shut my eyes easily. Thoughts of Sakura cross my mind.
"I was thinking how nice it'd be if I was your real sister," she'd said.
None of that tonight. I've got to get some sleep. A log topples over in the stove,
an owl hoots outside. And I topple down into an indistinct dream.
The next day's the same. Birds wake me up a little after six. I boil some water,
make a cup of tea, and have breakfast. Read on the porch, listen to music, go fill up the
water pail at the stream. And I walk down the path into the woods, this time carrying my
compass, glancing at it every once in a while to get a general idea of where the cabin is.
I found a hatchet in the shed and use it to chop simple hatch marks on trees. I clear out
some of the underbrush to make the path easier to follow.
Just like yesterday the forest is dark and deep, the towering trees forming a thick
wall on both sides. Something of the forest is hiding there, in the darkness between the
trees, like some 3-D painting of an animal, watching my every move. But the fear that
made me shudder isn't there anymore. I've made my own rules, and by following them I
won't get lost. At least I hope not.
I come to the place where I stopped yesterday and forge on, stepping into the sea
of ferns. After a while the path reemerges, and again I'm surrounded by a wall of trees,
on whose trunks I hack out some markings as I go. Somewhere in the branches above
me a huge bird flaps its wings, but looking up I can't spot it. My mouth is dry.
I walk on for a while and reach a round sort of clearing. Surrounded by tall trees,
it looks like the bottom of a gigantic well. Sunlight shoots down through the branches
like a spotlight illuminating the ground at my feet. The place feels special, somehow. I
sit down in the sunlight and let the faint warmth wash over me, taking out a chocolate
bar from my pocket and enjoying the sweet taste. Realizing all over again how
important sunlight is to human beings, I appreciate each second of that precious light.
The intense loneliness and helplessness I felt under those millions of stars has vanished.
But as time passes, the sun's angle shifts and the light disappears. I stand up and retrace
the path back to the cabin.
In the afternoon dark clouds suddenly color the sky a mysterious shade and it
starts raining hard, pounding the roof and windows of the cabin. I strip naked and run
outside, washing my face with soap and scrubbing myself all over. It feels wonderful. In
my joy I shut my eyes and shout out meaningless words as the large raindrops strike me
on the cheeks, the eyelids, chest, side, penis, legs, and butt--the stinging pain like a
religious initiation or something. Along with the pain there's a feeling of closeness, like
for once in my life the world's treating me fairly. I feel elated, as if all of a sudden I've
been set free. I face the sky, hands held wide apart, open my mouth wide, and gulp
down the falling rain.
Back inside the hut, I dry off with a towel, sit down on the bed, and look at my
penis--a light-colored, healthy, youthful penis. The head still stings a little from the rain.
For a long while I stare at this strange organ that, most of the time, has a mind of its own
and contemplates thoughts not shared by my brain.
I wonder if Oshima, when he was my age and stayed here, struggled with sexual
desire. He must have, but I can't picture him taking care of business on his own. He's too
detached, too cool for that.
"I was different from everybody else," he'd said. I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure he wasn't just spouting something off the top of his head. He didn't say it to
be mysterious and coy, either.
I consider jerking off but think better of it. Being pummeled by the rain so hard
made me feel strangely purified, and I want to hold on to that sensation a while longer. I
pull on some boxers, take a few deep breaths, and start doing squats. A hundred squats
later I do a hundred sit-ups. I focus on one muscle group at a time. Once my routine's
done, my mind's clear. The rain's stopped, the sun's starting to shine through breaks in
the clouds, and the birds have started chirping again.
But that calm won't last long, you know. It's like beasts that never tire, tracking
you everywhere you go. They come out at you deep in the forest. They're tough,
relentless, merciless, untiring, and they never give up. You might control yourself now,
and not masturbate, but they'll get you in the end, as a wet dream. You might dream
about raping your sister, your mother. It's not something you can control. It's a power
beyond you--and all you can do is accept it.
You're afraid of imagination. And even more afraid of dreams. Afraid of the
responsibility that begins in dreams. But you have to sleep, and dreams are a part of
sleep. When you're awake you can suppress imagination. But you can't suppress dreams.
I lie down in bed and listen to Prince on my headphones, concentrating on this
strangely unceasing music. The batteries run out in the middle of "Little Red Corvette,"
the music disappearing like it's been swallowed up by quicksand. I yank off my
headphones and listen. Silence, I discover, is something you can actually hear.
Chapter 16
The black dog stood up and led Nakata out of the study and down the dark corridor to
the kitchen, which had only a couple of windows and was dark. Though it was neat and
clean, it had an inert feel, like a science lab in school. The dog stopped in front of the
doors of a large refrigerator, turned around, and drilled Nakata with a cold look Open
the left door, he said in a low voice. Nakata knew it wasn't the dog talking but Johnnie
Walker, speaking to Nakata through him. Looking at Nakata through the dog's eyes.
Nakata did as he was told. The avocado green refrigerator was taller than he was,
and when he opened the left door the thermostat came on with a thump, the motor
groaning to life. White vapor, like fog, wafted out. This side of the refrigerator was a
freezer, at a very low setting.
Inside was a row of about twenty round, fruit-like objects, neatly arranged.
Nothing else. Nakata bent over and looked at them fixedly. When the vapor cleared he
saw it wasn't fruit at all but the severed heads of cats. Cut-off heads of all colors and
sizes, arranged on three shelves like oranges at a fruit stand. The cats' faces were frozen,
facing forward. Nakata gulped.
Take a good look, the dog commanded. Check with your own eyes whether
Goma's in there or not.
Nakata did this, examining the cats' heads one by one. He didn't feel afraid--his
mind focused on finding the missing little cat. Nakata carefully checked each head,
confirming that Goma's wasn't among them. No doubt about it--not a single tortoiseshell.
The faces of the bodyless cats had a strangely vacant expression, not one of them
appearing to have suffered. That, at least, brought Nakata a sigh of relief. A few of the
cats had their eyes closed, but most were staring out blankly at a point in space.
"I don't see Goma here," Nakata said in a flat tone. He cleared his throat and shut
the refrigerator door.
Are you absolutely sure?
"Yes, I'm sure."
The dog stood up and led Nakata back to the study. Johnnie Walker was still
seated in the swivel chair, waiting for him. As Nakata entered, he touched the brim of
his silk hat in greeting and smiled pleasantly. Then he clapped his hands loudly, twice,
and the dog left the room.
"I'm the one who cut off all those cats' heads," he said. He lifted his glass of
whisky and took a drink. "I'm collecting them."
"So you're the one who's been catching cats in that vacant lot and killing them."
"That's right. The infamous cat-killer Johnnie Walker, at your service."
"Nakata doesn't understand this so well, so do you mind if I ask a question?"
"Be my guest," Johnnie Walker said, lifting his glass. "Feel free to ask anything.
To save time, though, if you don't mind, I can guess that the first thing you want to
know is why I have to kill all these cats. Why I'm collecting their heads. Am I right?"
"Yes, that's right. That's what Nakata wants to know."
Johnnie Walker set his glass down on the desk and looked straight at Nakata.
"This is an important secret I wouldn't tell just anybody. For you, Mr. Nakata, I'll make
an exception, but I don't want you telling other people. Not that they'd believe you even
if you did." He chuckled.
"Listen--I'm not killing cats just for the fun of it. I'm not so disturbed I find it
amusing," he went on. "I'm not just some dilettante with time on his hands. It takes a lot
of time and effort to gather and kill this many cats. I'm killing them to collect their souls,
which I use to create a special kind of flute. And when I blow that flute it'll let me
collect even larger souls. Then I collect larger souls and make an even bigger flute.
Perhaps in the end I'll be able to make a flute so large it'll rival the universe. But first
come the cats. Gathering their souls is the starting point of the whole project. There's an
essential order you have to follow in everything. It's a way of showing respect,
following everything in the correct order. It's what you need to do when you're dealing
with other souls. It's not pineapples and melons I'm working with here, agreed?"
"Yes," Nakata replied. But actually he had no idea. A flute? Was he talking about
a flute you held sideways? Or maybe a recorder? What sort of sound would it make?
And what did he mean by cats' souls? All of this exceeded his limited powers of
comprehension. But Nakata did understand one thing: he had to locate Goma and get her
out of here.
"What you want to do is take Goma home," Johnnie Walker said, as though
reading Nakata's mind.
"That's right. Nakata wants to take Goma back to her home."
"That's your mission," Johnnie Walker said. "We all follow our mission in life.
That's natural. Now I imagine you've never heard a flute made out of cats' souls, have
you?"
"No, I haven't."
"Of course you haven't. You can't hear it with your ears."
"It's a flute you can't hear?"
"Correct. I can hear it, of course," Johnnie Walker said. "If I don't hear it none of
this would work. Ordinary people, though, can't detect it. Even if they do hear it, they
don't realize it. They may have heard it in the past but don't remember. A very strange
flute, for sure. But maybe--just maybe--you might be able to hear it, Mr. Nakata. If I had
a flute on me right now we could try it, but I'm afraid I don't." Then, as if recalling
something, he pointed one finger straight up. "Actually, I was about to cut off the heads
of the cats I've rounded up. Harvest time. I've got all the cats that can be caught in that
vacant lot, and it's time to move on. The cat you're looking for, Goma, is among them.
Of course if I cut her head off, you wouldn't be able to take her home to the Koizumis,
now would you?"
"That's right," Nakata said. He couldn't take back Goma's cut-off head to the
Koizumis. If those two little girls saw that they might give up eating forever.
"I want to cut off Goma's head, but you don't want that to happen. Our two
missions, our two interests, conflict. That happens a lot in the world. So I'll tell you
what--we'll negotiate. What I mean is, if you do something for me, I'll return the favor
and give you Goma safe and sound."
Nakata lifted a hand above his head and vigorously rubbed his salt-and-pepper
hair, his habitual pose when puzzling over something. "Is it something I can do?"
"I thought we'd already settled that," Johnnie Walker said with a wry smile.
"Yes, we did," Nakata said, remembering. "That's correct. We did settle that
already. Pardon me."
"We don't have a lot of time, so let me jump to the conclusion, if you don't mind.
What you can do for me is kill me. Take my life, in other words."
Hand resting on the top of his head, Nakata stared at Johnnie Walker for a long
time. "You want Nakata to kill you?"
"That's right," Johnnie Walker said. "Truthfully, I'm sick and tired of this life. I've
lived a long, long time. I don't even remember how old I am. And I don't feel like living
any longer. I'm sick and tired of killing cats, but as long as I live that's what I have to
do--murder one cat after another and harvest their souls. Following things in the correct
order, step one to step ten, then back to one again. An endless repetition. And I've had it!
Nobody respects what I'm doing, it doesn't make anybody happy. But the whole thing's
all fixed already. I can't just suddenly say I quit and stop what I'm doing. And taking my
own life isn't an option. That's already been decided too. There're all sorts of rules
involved. If I want to die, I have to get somebody else to kill me. That's where you come
in. I want you to fear me, to hate me with a passion--and then terminate me. First you
fear me. Then you hate me. And finally you kill me."
"But why--why ask me? Nakata's never ever killed anyone before. It's not the
kind of thing I'm suited for."
"I know. You've never killed anyone, and don't want to. But listen to me--there
are times in life when those kinds of excuses don't cut it anymore. Situations when
nobody cares whether you're suited for the task at hand or not. I need you to understand
that. For instance, it happens in war. Do you know what war is?"
"Yes, I do. There was a big war going on when Nakata was born. I heard about
it."
"When a war starts people are forced to become soldiers. They carry guns and go
to the front lines and have to kill soldiers on the other side. As many as they possibly
can. Nobody cares whether you like killing other people or not. It's just something you
have to do. Otherwise you're the one who gets killed." Johnnie Walker pointed his index
finger at Nakata's chest. "Bang!" he said. "Human history in a nutshell."
"Is the Governor going to make Nakata a soldier and order me to kill people?"
"Yes, that's what the Governor will do. Tell you to kill somebody."
Nakata thought about this but couldn't quite figure it out. Why in the world would
the Governor do that?
"You've got to look at it this way: this is war. You're a soldier, and you have to
make a decision. Either I kill the cats or you kill me. One or the other. You need to make
a choice right here and now. This might seem an outrageous choice, but consider this:
most choices we make in life are equally outrageous." Johnnie Walker lightly touched
his silk hat, as if making sure it was still in place.
"The one saving grace for you here--if indeed you need such a thing--is the fact
that I want to die. I've asked you to kill me, so you don't need to suffer any pangs of
conscience. You're doing exactly what I'm hoping for. It's not like you're killing
somebody who doesn't want to die. In fact, you're doing a good deed."
Nakata wiped away the beads of sweat that had formed on his hairline. "But
there's no way Nakata could do something like that. Even if you tell me to kill you, I
don't know how to go about it."
"I hear you," Johnnie Walker said admiringly. "You've never killed anybody
before, so you don't know how to go about it. All right then, let me explain. The knack
to killing someone, Mr. Nakata, is not to hesitate. Focus your prejudice and execute it
swiftly--that's the ticket when it comes to killing. I have an excellent example right here.
It's not a person, but it might help you get the picture."
Johnnie Walker stood up and picked up a large leather case from the shadows
below the desk. He placed it on the chair where he'd been sitting and opened it,
whistling a cheery tune. As if performing a magic trick, he extracted a cat from out of
the case. Nakata had never seen this cat before, a gray-striped male that had just reached
adulthood. The cat was limp, but its eyes were open. It looked conscious, though only
barely. Still whistling his merry tune--"Heigh-Ho" from Disney's Snow White, the one
the Seven Dwarves sang--Johnnie Walker held up the cat like he was showing off a fish
he'd just caught.
"I've got five cats inside this case, all from that vacant lot. A fresh batch. Just
picked, fresh from the grove, so to speak. I've given them all injections to paralyze them.
It's not an anesthetic--they're not asleep and they can feel pain, but they can't move their
arms or legs. Or even their heads. I do this to keep them from thrashing about. What I'm
going to do is slice open their chests with a knife, extract their still-beating hearts, and
cut their heads off. Right in front of your eyes. There'll be lots of blood, and
unimaginable pain. Imagine how much it'd hurt if somebody cut open your chest and
pulled out your heart! Same thing holds true for cats--it's got to hurt. I feel sorry for the
poor little things. I'm not some cold, cruel sadist, but there's nothing I can do about it.
There has to be pain. That's the rule. Rules everywhere you look here." He winked at
Nakata. "A job's a job. Got to accomplish your mission. I'm going to dispose of one cat
after another, and finish off Goma last. So you still have some time to decide what you
should do. Remember, now--it's either I kill the cats or you kill me. There's no other
choice."
Johnnie Walker placed the limp cat on top of the desk, opened a drawer, and with
both hands extracted a large black package. He carefully unwrapped it and spread out
the contents on the desk. These included a small electric saw, scalpels of various sizes,
and a very large knife, all of them gleaming like they'd just been sharpened. Johnnie
Walker lovingly checked each and every blade as he lined them up on the desk. Next he
got several metal trays from another drawer and arranged them, too, on the desk. Then
he took a large black plastic bag from a drawer. All the while whistling "Heigh-Ho."
"As I mentioned, Mr. Nakata, in everything there's a proper order," Johnnie
Walker said. "You can't look too far ahead. Do that and you'll lose sight of what you're
doing and stumble. I'm not saying you should focus solely on details right in front of
you, mind you. You've got to look ahead a bit or else you'll bump into something.
You've got to follow the proper order and at the same time keep an eye out for what's
ahead. That's critical, no matter what you're doing."
Johnnie Walker narrowed his eyes and gently stroked the cat's head. He ran the
tip of his index finger up and down the cat's belly, then picked up a scalpel in his right
hand and without any warning made an incision straight down the stomach. It all
happened in an instant. The belly split wide open and reddish guts spilled out. The cat
tried to scream but barely made any sound at all. His tongue, after all, was numb, and he
could hardly open his mouth. But his eyes were contorted in terrible pain. And Nakata
could well imagine how awful this pain was. A moment later blood gushed out, wetting
Johnnie Walker's hands and running down his vest. But he didn't pay attention. Still to
the accompaniment of "Heigh-Ho," he thrust his hand inside the cat's body and with a
small scalpel skillfully cut loose the tiny heart.
He placed the gory lump on his palm and held it out for Nakata to see. "Take a
peek. It's still beating."
Then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, he popped the heart into
his mouth and began chewing silently, leisurely savoring the taste. His eyes glistened
like a child enjoying a pastry hot from the oven.
He wiped the blood from his mouth with the back of his hand and carefully licked
his lips clean. "Fresh and warm. And still beating in my mouth."
Nakata stared at the scene before him without a word. He couldn't look away. The
smell of fresh blood filled the room.
Still whistling his jolly tune, Johnnie Walker sawed the cat's head off. The teeth
of the saw crunched through the bone and severed it. He seemed to know exactly what
he was doing. The neck bone wasn't very thick, so the whole operation was quickly
finished. But the sound had a strange weight to it. Johnnie Walker lovingly placed the
severed head on the metal tray. As if relishing a work of art, he narrowed his eyes and
gazed at it intently. He stopped whistling for a second, extracted something stuck
between his teeth with a fingernail, popped it in his mouth and carefully tasted it, then
smacked his lips, satisfied, and gulped it down. Next he opened the black plastic bag and
casually tossed in the dead cat's body like some useless shell.
"One down," Johnnie Walker said, spreading his bloody hands in front of Nakata.
"A bit of work, don't you think? You can enjoy a nice fresh heart, but look how bloody
you get. No, this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine, making the
green one red. A line from Macbeth. This isn't as bad as Macbeth, but you wouldn't
believe the dry-cleaning bills. This is a special outfit, after all. I should wear a surgical
gown and gloves, but I can't. Another rule, I'm afraid."
Nakata didn't say a word, though something was beginning to stir in his mind.
The room smelled of blood, and strains of "Heigh-Ho" rang in his ears.
Johnnie Walker pulled out the next cat from his bag, a white female, not so young,
with the tip of her tail bent a little. As before, he stroked the cat's head for a while, then
leisurely traced an invisible line down her stomach. He picked up a scalpel and again
made a quick cut to open up the chest. The rest was the same as before. The silent
scream, the convulsing body, guts spilling out. Pulling out the bloody heart, showing it
to Nakata, popping it in his mouth, chewing it slowly. The satisfied smile. Wiping the
blood away with the back of his hand. All with "Heigh-Ho" as background music.
Nakata sank back in his chair and closed his eyes. He held his head in his hands,
the fingertips digging into his temples. Something was definitely rising up within him, a
horrible confusion transforming his very being. He was breathing rapidly, and a sharp
pain throbbed in his neck. His vision was changing drastically.
"Mr. Nakata," Johnnie Walker said brightly, "don't poop out on me yet. We're just
getting to the main event. That was just the opening act, a mere warm-up. Now we're
getting to the lineup you know. So open your eyes wide and take a good long look. This
is the best part! I hope you'll appreciate how hard I've tried to make this entertaining for
you."
Whistling his tune, he took out the next cat. Sunk in his chair, Nakata opened his
eyes and looked at the next victim. His mind was a complete blank, and he couldn't even
stand up.
"I believe you already know each other," Johnnie Walker said, "but I'll do the
honors anyway. Mr. Nakata, this is Mr. Kawamura. Mr. Kawamura, Mr. Nakata."
Johnnie Walker tipped his hat in a theatrical gesture, greeting first Nakata, then the
paralyzed cat.
"Now that you've said hello, I'm afraid we move right into farewells. Hello, goodbye.
Like flowers scattered in a storm, man's life is one long farewell, as they say." He
gave Kawamura's soft stomach a gentle caress. "Now's the time to stop me if you're
going to, Mr. Nakata. Time's ticking away, and I won't hesitate. In the dictionary of the
infamous cat-killer Johnnie Walker, hesitate is one word you won't find."
And indeed without any hesitation at all he slit open Kawamura's belly. This time
the scream was audible. Maybe the cat's tongue hadn't been fully paralyzed, or perhaps
it was a special kind of scream that only Nakata could hear. An awful, bloodcurdling
scream. Nakata closed his eyes and held his trembling head in his hands.
"You have to look!" Johnnie Walker commanded. "That's another one of our rules.
Closing your eyes isn't going to change anything. Nothing's going to disappear just
because you can't see what's going on. In fact, things will be even worse the next time
you open your eyes. That's the kind of world we live in, Mr. Nakata. Keep your eyes
wide open. Only a coward closes his eyes. Closing your eyes and plugging up your ears
won't make time stand still."
Nakata did as he was told and opened his eyes.
Once he was sure they were open, Johnnie Walker made a show of devouring
Kawamura's heart, taking more time than before to savor it. "It's soft and warm. Just like
fresh eel liver," Johnnie Walker commented. He then lifted a bloody index finger to his
mouth and sucked it. "Once you've acquired a taste for this, you get hooked. Especially
the sticky blood."
He wiped the blood off the scalpel, whistling cheerily as always, and sawed off
Kawamura's head. The fine teeth of the blade cut through the bone and blood spurted out
everywhere.
"Please, Mr. Walker, Nakata can't stand it anymore!"
Johnnie Walker stopped whistling. He halted his work and scratched an earlobe.
"That won't fly, Mr. Nakata. I'm sorry you feel bad, I really am, but I can't just say,
Okay, will do, and call this off. I told you. This is war. It's hard to stop a war once it
starts. Once the sword is drawn, blood's going to be spilled. This doesn't have anything
to do with theory or logic, or even my ego. It's just a rule, pure and simple. If you don't
want any more cats to be killed, you've got to kill me. Stand up, focus your hatred, and
strike me down. And you've got to do it now. Do that and it's all over. End of story."
Johnnie Walker started whistling again. He finished cutting off Kawamura's head
and tossed the headless body into the garbage bag. Now there were three heads lined up
on the metal tray. They'd suffered such agony, yet their faces were as strangely vacant as
those of the cats lined up in the freezer.
"Next comes the Siamese." Johnnie Walker said this and then extracted a limp
Siamese from his bag--which of course turned out to be Mimi. "So now we come to
little 'Mi Chiamano Mimi.' The Puccini opera. This little cat really does have that
elegant coquetry, doesn't she? I'm a big Puccini fan, myself. Puccini's music is kind of--
what should I call it?--eternally antagonistic to the times. Mere popular entertainment,
you might argue, but it never gets old. Quite an artistic accomplishment."
He whistled a bar from "Mi Chiamano Mimi."
"But I have to tell you, Mr. Nakata, it took some doing to catch Mimi. She's
clever and cautious, very quick on the draw. Not the type to get suckered into anything.
One tough customer. But the cat that can elude Johnnie Walker, the matchless cat-killer,
has yet to be born. Not that I'm bragging or anything, I'm just trying to convey how hard
it was to nab her.... At any rate, voilà! Your friend Mimi! Siamese are my absolute
favorites. You're not aware of this, but a Siamese cat's heart is a real gem. Sort of like
truffles. It's okay, Mimi. Never fear--Johnnie Walker's here! Ready to enjoy your warm,
cute little heart. Ah--you're trembling!"
"Johnnie Walker." From deep inside himself Nakata managed to force out the
words in a low voice. "Please, stop it. If you don't, Nakata's going to go crazy. I don't
feel like myself anymore."
Johnnie Walker laid Mimi down on the desk and as always let his fingers slowly
crawl along her belly. "So you're no longer yourself," he said carefully and quietly.
"That's very important, Mr. Nakata. A person not being himself anymore." He picked up
a scapel he hadn't used yet and tested its sharpness with the tip of his finger. Then, as if
doing a trial cut, he ran the blade along the back of his hand. A moment later blood
oozed up, dripping onto the desk and Mimi's body. Johnnie Walker chuckled. "A
person's not being himself anymore," he repeated. "You're no longer yourself. That's the
ticket, Mr. Nakata. Wonderful! The most important thing of all. O, full of scorpions is
my mind! Macbeth again."
Without a word, Nakata stood up. No one, not even Nakata himself, could stop
him. With long strides he walked over to the desk and grabbed what looked like a steak
knife. Grasping the wooden handle firmly, he plunged the blade into Johnnie Walker's
stomach, piercing the black vest, then stabbed again in another spot. He could hear
something, a loud sound, and at first didn't know what it was. But then he understood.
Johnnie Walker was laughing. Stabbed in the stomach and chest, his blood spouting out,
he continued to laugh.
"That's the stuff!" he yelled. "You didn't hesitate. Well done!" Laughing like it
was the funniest joke he'd ever heard. Soon though, his laughter turned into a sob. The
blood gurgling in his throat sounded like a drain coming unplugged. A terrible
convulsion wracked his body, and blood gushed out of his mouth along with dark, slimy
lumps--the hearts of the cats he'd eaten. The blood spewed over the desk, onto Nakata's
golf shirt. Both men were drenched in blood. Mimi, too, lying on the desk, was soaked
with it.
Johnnie Walker collapsed at Nakata's feet. He was on his side, curled up like a
child on a cold night, and was unmistakably dead. His left hand was pressed against his
throat, his right thrust straight out as though reaching for something. The convulsions
had ceased and, of course, the laughter. A faint sneer still showed on his lips. Blood
puddled on the wooden floor, and the silk hat had rolled off into a corner. The hair on
the back of Johnnie Walker's head was thin, the skin visible beneath. Without the hat he
looked much older and more feeble.
Nakata dropped the knife and it clattered on the floor as loudly as the gear of
some large machine clanking away in the distance. Nakata stood next to the body for a
long time. Everything in the room had come to a standstill. Only the blood continued,
silently, to flow, the puddle slowly spreading across the floor.
Finally, Nakata pulled himself together and gathered Mimi up from the desk.
Warm and limp in his hands, she was covered in blood but apparently unharmed. Mimi
looked up as if trying to tell him something, but the drug kept her mouth from moving.
Nakata then found Goma inside the case and lifted her out. He'd only seen photos
of her, but felt a wave of nostalgia like he was meeting a long-lost friend. "Goma...," he
murmured. Holding the two cats, Nakata sat down on the sofa. "Let's go home," he told
them, but he couldn't stand up.
The black dog had appeared from somewhere and sat down next to his dead
master. He might have lapped at the pool of blood, but Nakata couldn't remember for
sure. His head felt heavy and dim, and he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. His
mind began to fade and, before he knew it, sank down into the darkness.
Chapter 17
It's my third night in the cabin. With each passing day I've gotten more used to the
silence and how incredibly dark it is. The night doesn't scare me anymore--or at least not
as much. I fill the stove with firewood, settle down in front of it, and read. When I get
tired, I just space out and stare at the flames. I never grow tired of looking at them. They
come in all shapes and colors, and move around like living things--they are born,
connect up, part company, and die.
When it's not cloudy I go outside and gaze up at the sky. The stars don't seem as
intimidating as before, and I'm starting to feel closer to them. Each one gives out its own
special light. I identify certain stars and watch how they twinkle in the night. Every once
in a while they blaze more brightly for a moment. The moon hangs there, pale and bright,
and if I look closely it's like I can make out individual crags on the surface. I don't form
any coherent thoughts, just gaze, enthralled, at the sky.
Having no music doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. There're lots of
other sounds that take its place--the chirping of birds, the cries of all sorts of insects, the
gurgle of the brook, the rustling of leaves. Rain falls, something scrambles across the
cabin roof, and sometimes I hear indescribable sounds I can't explain. I never knew the
world was full of so many beautiful, natural sounds. I've ignored them my entire life, but
not now. I sit on the porch for hours with my eyes closed, trying to be inconspicuous,
picking up each and every sound around me.
The woods don't scare me as much as they used to, either, and I've started to feel
a kind of closeness and respect. That said, I don't venture too far from the cabin, and
stay on the path. As long as I follow these rules, it shouldn't get too precarious. That's
the important thing--follow the rules and the woods will wordlessly accept me, sharing
some of their peace and beauty. Cross the line, though, and beasts of silence lay in wait
to maul me with razor-sharp claws.
I often lie down in the round little clearing and let the sunlight wash over me.
Eyes closed tight, I give myself up to it, ears tuned to the wind whipping through the
treetops. Wrapped in the deep fragrance of the forest, I listen to the flapping of birds'
wings, to the stirring of the ferns. I'm freed from gravity and float up--just a little--from
the ground and drift in the air. Of course I can't stay there forever. It's just a momentary
sensation--open my eyes and it's gone. Still, it's an overwhelming experience. Being able
to float in the air.
It rains hard a couple times, but doesn't last, and each time I run outside, naked, to
wash myself. Sometimes I get all sweaty exercising, rip off my clothes, and sunbathe on
the porch. I drink a lot of tea, and concentrate on reading, sitting on the porch or by the
stove. Books on history, science, folklore, mythology, sociology, psychology,
Shakespeare, you name it. Instead of racing straight through, I reread parts I think are
most important till I understand them, to get something tangible out of them. All sorts of
knowledge seeps, bit by bit, into my brain. I imagine how great it'd be to stay here as
long as I wanted. There are lots of books on the shelf I'd like to read, still plenty of food.
But I know I'm just passing through and will have to leave before long. This place is too
calm, too natural--too complete. I don't deserve it. At least not yet.
On the fourth day Oshima shows up late in the morning. I'm stark naked,
sprawled on the chair on the porch, dozing in the sun, and don't hear him approach. I
don't hear the sound of his car. Shouldering a backpack, he's walked here up the road.
He quietly steps up on the porch, sticks out his hand, and lightly brushes my head.
Startled, I leap to my feet and scramble around for a towel. There isn't one handy.
"Don't sweat it," Oshima says. "When I stayed here I used to sunbathe nude all
the time. It feels great, having the sun on places it never reaches."
Naked like this in front of him, I feel totally defenseless and vulnerable, my pubic
hair, penis, balls all exposed. I have no idea what to do. It's a little too late to cover up.
"Hey," I say, straining to sound casual. "So you walked up?"
"It's such a nice day I decided to," he says. "I left my car down by the gate." He
takes a towel draped over the railing and hands it to me. I wrap it around my waist and
can finally relax.
Singing a song in a low voice he boils water, then takes out flour, eggs, and milk
from his pack and whips up some pancakes in the frying pan. Tops these with butter and
syrup. He then takes out lettuce, tomatoes, and an onion. He's very careful with the
kitchen knife as he chops up everything for a salad. We have all this for lunch.
"So how were your three days here?" he asks, cutting a piece of pancake.
I tell him what a wonderful time I had. I omit the part about going into the woods.
Somehow, it's better not to talk about it.
"I'm glad," Oshima says. "I was hoping you'd like it here."
"But we're going back to the city now, aren't we?"
"That's right. It's time to go back."
Getting ready to leave, we briskly straighten up the cabin. Wash the dishes and
put them away in the shelves, clean up the stove. Empty the water pail, shut the valve in
the propane tank. Store the food that will last in the cupboard, throw the rest away.
Sweep the floor, wipe off the tops of the tables and chairs. Dig a hole outside to bury the
garbage.
As Oshima locks up the cabin, I turn to look one last time. Up till a minute ago it
felt so real, but now it seems imaginary. Just a few steps is all it takes for everything
associated with it to lose all sense of reality. And me--the person who was there until a
moment ago--now I seem imaginary too. It takes thirty minutes to walk to where
Oshima parked the car, and we hardly exchange a word as we go down the mountain
road. Oshima's humming some melody. I let my mind wander.
At the bottom, the little green sports car blends into the background of the forest.
Oshima closes the gate to discourage trespassers, wraps the chain around it twice, and
locks the padlock. Like before, I secure my backpack to the rack on the back of the car.
The top's down.
"Back to the city," Oshima says.
I nod.
"I'm sure you enjoyed living all alone with nature like that, but it's not easy to live
there for a long time," Oshima says. He puts on sunglasses and fastens his seatbelt.
I sit down beside him and snap on my seatbelt.
"In theory it's not impossible to live like that, and of course there are people who
do. But nature is actually kind of unnatural, in a way. And relaxation can actually be
threatening. It takes experience and preparation to really live with those contradictions.
So we're going back to the city for the time being. Back to civilization."
Oshima steps on the gas and we start down the mountain road. This time he's in
no hurry and drives at a leisurely pace, enjoying the scenery and the rush of wind that
whips through his bangs. The unpaved road ends and we start down the narrow paved
road, passing villages and fields.
"Speaking of contradictions," Oshima suddenly says, "when I first met you I felt a
kind of contradiction in you. You're seeking something, but at the same time running
away for all you're worth."
"What is it I'm seeking?"
Oshima shakes his head. He glances in the rearview mirror and frowns. "I have
no idea. I'm just saying I got that impression."
I don't reply.
"From my own experience, when someone is trying very hard to get something,
they don't. And when they're running away from something as hard as they can, it
usually catches up with them. I'm generalizing, of course."
"If you generalize about me, then, what's in my future? If I'm seeking and running
at the same time."
"That's a tough one," Oshima says, and smiles. A moment passes before he goes
on. "If I had to say anything it'd be this: Whatever it is you're seeking won't come in the
form you're expecting."
"Kind of an ominous prophecy."
"Like Cassandra."
"Cassandra?" I ask.
"The Greek tragedy. Cassandra was the princess of Troy who prophesied. She
was a temple priestess, and Apollo gave her the power to predict fate. In return he tried
to force her to sleep with him, but she refused and he put a curse on her. Greek gods are
more mythological than religious figures. By that I mean they have the same character
flaws humans do. They fly off the handle, get horny, jealous, forgetful. You name it."
He takes a small box of lemon drops out of the glove compartment and pops one
in his mouth. He motions for me to take one, and I do.
"What kind of curse was it?"
"The curse on Cassandra?"
I nod.
"The curse Apollo laid on her was that all her prophecies would be true, but
nobody would ever believe them. On top of that, her prophecies would all be unlucky
ones--predictions of betrayals, accidents, deaths, the country falling into ruin. That sort
of thing. People not only didn't believe her, they began to despise her. If you haven't
read them yet, I really recommend the plays by Euripides or Aeschylus. They show a lot
of the essential problems we struggle with even today. In koros."
"Koros? What's that?"
"That's what they called the chorus they used in Greek plays. It stands at the back
of the stage and explains in unison the situation or what the characters are feeling deep
down inside. Sometimes they even try to influence the characters. It's a very convenient
device. Sometimes I wish I had my own chorus standing behind me."
"Are you able to prophesy?"
"No such luck." He smiles. "For better or for worse, I don't have that kind of
power. If I sound like I'm always predicting ominous things, it's because I'm a
pragmatist. I use deductive reasoning to generalize, and I suppose this sometimes winds
up sounding like unlucky prophecies. You know why? Because reality's just the
accumulation of ominous prophecies come to life. All you have to do is open a
newspaper on any given day and weigh the good news versus the bad news, and you'll
see what I mean."
Oshima carefully downshifts at each curve, the kind of practiced gear shifting you
hardly notice. Only the change in the sound of the engine gives it away.
"There is one piece of good news, though," he says. "We've decided to take you
in. You'll be a staff member of the Komura Memorial Library. Which I think you're
qualified for."
Instinctively I glance at him. "You mean I'm going to be working at the library?"
"More precisely, from now on you'll be a part of the library. You're going to be
staying in the library, living there. You'll open the doors when it's time for the library to
open, shut them when it's time to close up. As I said before, you seem to be a pretty selfdisciplined
sort of person, and fairly strong, so I don't imagine the job will be very hard
for you. Miss Saeki and I aren't all that strong physically, so it'll really help us out a lot.
Other than that, you'll just help with small day-to-day things. Nothing to speak of, really.
Making delicious coffee for me, going out shopping for us. We've prepared a room that's
attached to the library for you to stay in. It's originally a guest room, but we don't have
any guests staying over so it hasn't been used for a long time. That's where you'll live. It
has its own shower, too. The best thing is you'll be in the library so you can read
whatever you like."
"But why--" I begin to say, but can't finish.
"Why are we doing this? It's all based on a very simple principle. I understand
you, and Miss Saeki understands me. I accept you, and she accepts me. So even if you're
some unknown fifteen-year-old runaway, that's not a problem. So, what do you think?"
I give it some thought. "All I was looking for was a roof over my head. That's all
that matters right now. I don't really know what it means to become part of the library,
but if it means I can live there, I'm grateful. At least I won't have to commute anymore."
"Then it's settled," Oshima says. "Let's go to the library. So you can become a
part of it."
We get on the highway and pass a number of towns, a giant billboard for a loan
company, a gas station with gaudy decorations, a glass-enclosed restaurant, a love hotel
made up to look like a European castle, an abandoned video store with only its sign left,
a pachinko place with an enormous parking lot, a McDonald's, 7-Eleven, Yoshinoya,
Denny's.... Noisy reality starts to surround us. The hiss of eighteen-wheelers' air brakes,
horns, and exhaust. Everything near me until now--the fire in the stove, the twinkle of
the stars, the stillness of the forest--has faded away. I find it hard to even imagine them.
"There are a couple of things you should know about Miss Saeki," Oshima says.
"When she was little, my mother and Miss Saeki were classmates and very close. She
says that Miss Saeki was a bright little girl. She got good grades, was good at
composition, sports of all kinds, and could play the piano well, too. She was the best at
whatever she tried. And beautiful. Of course she's still quite a stunning person."
I nod.
"When she was still in grade school she had a sweetheart. The eldest son of the
Komura family--a distant relative, actually. They were the same age and made a
handsome couple, a regular Romeo and Juliet. They lived near each other and were
never apart. And when they became adults they fell in love. They were like one body
and spirit, according to my mother."
We're waiting at a red light, and Oshima looks up at the sky. When the signal
turns green, he steps on the gas and we zoom out in front of a tanker truck. "Do you
remember what I told you in the library? About how people are always wandering
around, searching for their other half?"
"That part about male/male, female/female, and male/female?"
"Right. What Aristophanes said. How we stumble through our lives desperately
fumbling for our other half. Miss Saeki and that young man never had to do that. They
were born with their other half right there in front of them."
"They were lucky."
Oshima nods. "Absolutely. Up to a point."
He rubs his chin with his palm like he's checking out how well he shaved. There's
no trace of a razor--his skin is as smooth as porcelain.
"When the young man was eighteen he went to Tokyo to go to college. He had
good grades and a major he was interested in. He also wanted to see what the big city
was like. She went to a local college and majored in piano. This is a conservative part of
the country, and she came from an old-fashioned kind of family. She was an only child,
and her parents didn't want her going off to Tokyo. So the two of them were separated
for the first time in their lives. Just like God had cut them cleanly apart with a knife.
"Of course they wrote to each other every day. 'It might be good for us to try
being apart like this,' he wrote her. 'Then we can really tell how much we mean to each
other.' But she didn't believe that. She knew their relationship was real enough that they
didn't need to go out of their way to test it. It was a one-in-a-million union, fated to be,
something that could never be broken apart. She was absolutely sure of that. But he
wasn't. Or maybe he was, but simply didn't accept it. So he went ahead and went to
Tokyo, thinking that overcoming a few obstacles would strengthen their love for each
other. Men are like that sometimes.
"When she was nineteen Miss Saeki wrote a poem, set it to music, and played the
piano and sang it. It was a melancholy melody, innocent and lovely. The lyrics, on the
other hand, were symbolic, contemplative, hard to figure out. The contrast gave the song
a kind of spirit and immediacy. Of course the whole song, lyrics and melody, was her
way of crying out to her boyfriend, so far away. She sang the song a few times in front
of people. She was ordinarily shy, but she loved to sing and had even been in a folk
music band in college. Someone was very impressed by the song, made a demo tape,
and sent it to a friend of his who was a director at a record company. He loved the song
and had her go to their studio in Tokyo and record it.
"It was her first time in Tokyo, and she was able to see her boyfriend. Between
recording sessions they were able to love each other, as before. My mother said she
thought they'd had a sexual relationship since they were around fourteen. Both were
rather precocious, and like many precocious young people they found it hard to grow up.
It was as if they were eternally fourteen or fifteen. They clung to each other and could
again feel the intensity of their love. Neither one of them had ever been attracted to
anyone else. Even while they were apart, no one else could ever come between them.
Sorry--am I boring you with this fairy tale romance?"
I shake my head. "I have a feeling you're about to come to a turning point."
"You're right," Oshima says. "That's how stories happen--with a turning point, an
unexpected twist. There's only one kind of happiness, but misfortune comes in all shapes
and sizes. It's like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness a story. Anyway,
the record went on sale and was a huge hit. It kept on selling--a million copies, two
million, I'm not sure of the exact figure. At any rate it was a record-breaking number at
the time. Her photo was on the record jacket, a picture of her seated at a grand piano in
the studio, smiling at the camera.
"She hadn't prepared any other songs, so the B side of the single was an
instrumental version of the same song. With a piano and an orchestra, she of course
playing the piano. A beautiful performance. It was around 1970. The song was on all the
radio stations at the time, my mother said. This was before I was born, so I don't know
for sure. This was her one and only song as a professional singer. She didn't put out an
LP or a follow-up single."
"I wonder if I've heard that song."
"Do you listen to the radio much?"
I shake my head. I hardly ever listen to the radio.
"You probably haven't heard it, then. Unless it's on some oldies station, chances
are you haven't. But it's a wonderful song. I have it on a CD and listen to it every once in
a while. When Miss Saeki's not around, of course. She hates any mention of the song.
She doesn't like anyone bringing up the past."
"What's the name of the song?"
"'Kafka on the Shore.'" Oshima says.
"'Kafka on the Shore'?"
"That's correct, Kafka Tamura. The same name as you. A strange coincidence,
don't you think?"
"But Kafka isn't my real name. Tamura is, though."
"But you chose it yourself, right?"
I nod. I'd decided a long time ago that this was the right name for the new me.
"That's the point, I'd say," Oshima says.
Miss Saeki's boyfriend died when he was twenty, Oshima goes on. Right when
"Kafka on the Shore" was a hit. His college was on strike during the period of student
unrest and shut down. He went to bring supplies to a friend of his who was manning the
barricades, just before ten one night. The students occupying the building mistook him
for a leader of an opposing faction--he did resemble him a lot--and grabbed him, tied
him to a chair, and interrogated him as a spy. He tried to explain that they'd made a
mistake, but every time he did they smashed him with a steel pipe or baton. When he
fell to the floor they'd kick him with their boots. By dawn he was dead. His skull was
caved in, his ribs broken, his lungs ruptured. They tossed his corpse out on the street like
a dead dog. Two days later the college asked the national guard to come in, and within a
couple of hours the student revolt was put down and several of them were arrested and
charged with murder. The students confessed what they'd done and were put on trial, but
since it wasn't premeditated two of them were convicted of involuntary manslaughter
and given short prison sentences. His death was totally pointless.
Miss Saeki never sang again. She locked herself in her room and wouldn't talk to
anybody, even on the phone. She didn't go to his funeral, and dropped out of college.
After a few months, people suddenly realized she was no longer in town. Nobody knows
where she went or what she did. Her parents refused to discuss it. Maybe even they
didn't know where she'd been. She vanished into thin air. Even her best friend, Oshima's
mother, didn't have a clue. Rumors flew that she'd been committed to a mental hospital
after a failed suicide attempt in the deep forests surrounding Mount Fuji. Others said a
friend of a friend had spotted her on the streets of Tokyo. According to this person she
was working in Tokyo as a writer or something. Other rumors had it she was married
and had a child. All of these, though, were groundless, with nothing to back them up.
Twenty years passed.
No matter where she was or what she was doing all this time, Miss Saeki didn't
hurt for money. Her royalties for "Kafka on the Shore" were deposited in a bank account,
and even after taxes still amounted to a substantial sum. She got royalties every time the
song was played on the radio or included in an oldies compilation. So it was simple for
her to live far away, out of the limelight. Besides, her family was rich and she was their
only daughter.
Suddenly, twenty-five years later, Miss Saeki reappeared in Takamatsu. The
ostensible reason was her mother's funeral. (Her father had died five years before, but
she hadn't come to the funeral.) She held a small service for her mother and then, after
things had quieted down, sold the house she'd been born and raised in. She moved into
an apartment she'd purchased in a quiet part of the city and seemed to settle down again.
After a time she had some talks with the Komura family. (The head of the family, after
the death of the eldest son, was his younger brother, three years younger. It was just the
two of them, and no one knows what they talked about, exactly.) The upshot was Miss
Saeki became head of the Komura Library.
Even now she's slim and beautiful and has the same neat, smart look you see on
the record jacket of "Kafka on the Shore." But there's one thing missing: that lovely,
innocent smile. She still smiles from time to time, definitely a charming smile, but it's
always limited somehow, a smile that never goes beyond the moment. A high, invisible
wall surrounds her, holding people at arm's length. Every morning she drives her gray
Volkswagen Golf to the library, and drives it back home in the evening.
Back in her hometown, she had very little to do with former friends and relatives.
If they happen to meet she makes polite conversation, but this seldom goes beyond a
few standard topics. If the past happens to come up-especially if it involves her--she
makes a quick, smooth segue to another topic. She's always polite and kind, but her
words lack the kind of curiosity and excitement you'd normally expect. Her true
feelings--assuming such things exist--remain hidden away. Except for when a practical
sort of decision has to be made, she never gives her personal opinion about anything.
She seldom talks about herself, instead letting others talk, nodding warmly as she listens.
But most people start to feel vaguely uneasy when talking with her, as if they suspect
they're wasting her time, trampling on her private, graceful, dignified world. And that
impression is, for the most part, correct.
So even after settling back into her hometown, she remained a cipher. A stylish
woman wrapped in refined mystery. Something about her made it hard to approach her.
Even her nominal employers, the Komura family, kept their distance.
Eventually Oshima became her assistant and started to work in the library. At the
time Oshima wasn't working or going to school, just staying at home reading and
listening to music. Except for a few people he exchanged e-mails with, he hardly had
any friends. Because of his hemophilia, he spent a lot of time going to see a specialist at
the hospital, riding around town in his Mazda Miata, and except for his regular
appointments at the University Hospital in Hiroshima and the occasional stay at the
cabin in the Kochi mountains, he never left town. Not to imply that he was unhappy
with this life. One day Oshima's mother happened to introduce him to Miss Saeki, who
took an instant liking to him. The feeling was mutual, and the notion of working in a
library intrigued him. Oshima soon became the only person Miss Saeki normally dealt
with or spoke to.
"Sounds to me like Miss Saeki came back here in order to become head of the
library," I say.
"I'd have to agree. Her mother's funeral was just the opportunity that brought her
back. Her hometown must be so full of bittersweet memories that I imagine it was a
hard decision to return."
"Why was the library so important to her?"
"Her boyfriend used to live in a building that's part of the library now. He was the
eldest Komura son, and a love of reading was in his blood, I suppose. He liked to be
alone--another family trait. So when he went into junior high he insisted on living apart
from the main house, in a separate building, and his parents gave their okay. The whole
family loved reading, so they could understand where he was coming from. If you want
to be surrounded by books, it's fine with us--that kind of thing. So he lived in that annex,
with nobody bothering him, coming back to the main house only for meals. Miss Saeki
went to see him there almost every day. The two of them studied together, listened to
music, and talked forever. And most likely made love there. The place was their own bit
of paradise."
Both hands resting on top of the steering wheel, Oshima looks over at me. "That's
where you'll be living now, Kafka. In that room. As I said, the library's been renovated,
but it's the very same room."
Silence on my part.
"Miss Saeki's life basically stopped at age twenty, when her lover died. No,
maybe not age twenty, maybe much earlier.... I don't know the details, but you need to
be aware of this. The hands of the clock buried inside her soul ground to a halt then.
Time outside, of course, flows on as always, but she isn't affected by it. For her, what we
consider normal time is essentially meaningless."
"Meaningless?"
Oshima nods. "Like it doesn't exist."
"What you're saying is Miss Saeki still lives in that frozen time?"
"Exactly. I'm not saying she's some living corpse or anything. When you get to
know her better you'll understand."
Oshima reaches out and lays a hand on my knee in a totally natural gesture.
"Kafka, in everybody's life there's a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point
where you can't go forward anymore. And when we reach that point, all we can do is
quietly accept the fact. That's how we survive."
We're about to merge onto the main highway. Before we do, Oshima stops the car,
puts up the top, and slips a Schubert sonata into the CD player.
"There's one other thing I'd like you to be aware of," he goes on. "Miss Saeki has
a wounded heart. To some extent that's true of all of us, present company included. But
Miss Saeki has a special individual wound that goes beyond the usual meaning of the
term. Her soul moves in mysterious ways. I'm not saying she's dangerous--don't get me
wrong. On a day-to-day level she's definitely got her act together, probably more than
anybody else I know. She's charming, deep, intelligent. But just don't let it bother you if
you notice something odd about her sometimes."
"Odd?" I can't help asking.
Oshima shakes his head. "I really like Miss Saeki, and respect her. I'm sure you'll
come to feel the same way."
This doesn't really answer my question, but Oshima doesn't say anything. With
perfect timing he shifts gears, steps on the gas, and passes a small van just before we
enter a tunnel.
Chapter 18
Nakata found himself faceup in a clump of weeds. As he awakened he slowly opened
his eyes. It was night, but he couldn't see any stars or the moon. Still, the sky was faintly
light. He could smell the strong scent of summer grasses and hear insects buzzing
around. Somehow he was back in the vacant lot he'd been staking out every day. Feeling
something rough and warm brush against his face, he turned and saw two cats eagerly
licking both his cheeks with their tiny tongues. It was Goma and Mimi. Nakata slowly
sat up, reached out, and petted them. "Was Nakata asleep?" he asked.
The cats cried out like they were complaining about something, but Nakata
couldn't catch the words. He had no idea what they were trying to tell him. They were
just two cats meowing.
"I beg your pardon, but I can't understand what you're trying to say." He stood up
and checked his body to make sure there was nothing out of the ordinary. He felt no pain,
and his arms and legs were working fine. His eyes took some time to adjust to the
darkness, but once they did he saw that there wasn't any blood on his arms or clothes.
His clothes weren't rumpled or messed up, either, and looked the same as when he'd left
his apartment. His canvas bag was right beside him, lunch and thermos inside, and his
hat was inside his trouser pocket where it belonged. Everything was in order. Nakata
couldn't figure out what was going on.
In order to save the two cats, he'd stabbed Johnnie Walker--the cat-killer--to death.
That much he remembered all too clearly. He could still feel the knife in his hands. It
wasn't a dream--blood had spurted out of Johnnie Walker and he'd collapsed to the floor,
curled up, and died. Then Nakata had sunk back on the couch and lost consciousness.
And the next thing he knew, here he was lying among the weeds in the vacant lot. But
how did he get back here? He didn't even know the road back. And his clothes had no
blood on them at all. Seeing Mimi and Goma beside him proved it wasn't a dream, but
for some strange reason now he couldn't understand a word they said.
Nakata sighed. He couldn't think straight. But never mind--he'd figure it all out
later. He slung the bag over his shoulder, picked up the two cats, and left the vacant lot.
Once outside the fence, Mimi started to squirm as if she wanted to be let down.
Nakata lowered her to the ground. "Mimi, you can go back home on your own, I
imagine. It's nearby."
That's right, Mimi's wagging tail seemed to say.
"Nakata doesn't understand what's happened, but for some reason I can't talk with
you anymore. But I was able to find Goma, and I'd better take her back to the Koizumis.
Everyone's waiting for her. Thank you so much for everything, Mimi."
Mimi meowed, wagged her tail again, then scurried off and disappeared around
the corner. There was no blood on her, either. Nakata decided to remember that.
The Koizumis were overjoyed by Goma's return. It was past ten p. m. but the
children were still up, brushing their teeth before bed. Their parents were drinking tea
and watching the news on TV, and they welcomed Nakata warmly. The two little girls,
in pajamas, jostled each other to be the first to hug their precious pet. They quickly gave
Goma some milk and cat food, which she eagerly tucked into.
"My apologies for stopping by so late at night. It would be much better to come
earlier, but Nakata couldn't help it."
"That's all right," Mrs. Koizumi said. "Please don't worry about it."
"Don't worry about the time," her husband said. "That cat is like a member of the
family. I can't tell you how happy we are you could find her. How about coming in and
having a cup of tea?"
"No thank you, Nakata must be going. I just wanted to get Goma back to you as
soon as possible."
Mrs. Koizumi went to another room and returned with Nakata's pay in an
envelope, which her husband handed to Nakata. "It's not much, but please accept this
token for all you've done. We're very grateful."
"Thank you very much. Much obliged," Nakata said, and bowed.
"I'm surprised, though, you could find her in the dark like this."
"Yes, it's a long story. Nakata can't tell the whole thing. I'm not too bright, and
not so good at giving long explanations."
"That's quite all right. We are so grateful to you, Mr. Nakata," Mrs. Koizumi said.
"I'm sorry it's just leftovers, but we have some grilled eggplant and vinegared cucumbers
we'd like you to take home with you."
"I'd be happy to. Grilled eggplant and vinegared cucumbers are some of Nakata's
favorites."
Nakata stowed the Tupperware container of food and the envelope in his bag. He
walked quickly toward the station and went to a police box near the shopping district. A
young officer was seated at a desk inside, intently working on some paperwork. His hat
was on top of the desk.
Nakata slid the glass door open. "Good evening. Sorry to bother you," he said.
"Good evening," the policeman replied. He looked up from the paperwork and
gave Nakata a once-over. Basically a nice, harmless old man, was his professional
assessment, most likely stopping by to ask directions.
Standing at the entrance, Nakata removed his hat and stuffed it in his pocket, then
took a handkerchief from the other pocket and blew his nose. He folded up the
handkerchief and put it back.
"Is there something I can do for you?" the policeman asked.
"Yes, there is. Nakata just murdered somebody."
The policeman dropped his pen on the desk and stared openmouthed at the old
man. For a moment he was speechless. What the--?
"Here, why don't you sit down," he said dubiously, pointing to a chair opposite
him. He reached out and checked that he had his pistol, baton, and handcuffs on him.
"Thank you," Nakata said, and sat down. Back held straight, hands resting in his
lap, he looked straight at the officer.
"So what you're saying is... you killed somebody?"
"Yes. Nakata killed a person with a knife. Just a little while ago," Nakata
admitted frankly.
The young officer took out a form, glanced at the clock on the wall, and noted
down the time and the statement about a knifing. "I'll need your name and address."
"My name is Satoru Nakata, and my address is--"
"Just a moment. What characters do you write your name with?"
"I don't know about characters. I'm sorry, but I can't write. Or read, either."
The officer frowned. "You're telling me you can't read at all? You can't even
write your name?"
"That's right. Until I was nine I could read and write, but then there was an
accident and after that I can't. Nakata's not too bright."
The officer sighed and laid down his pen. "I can't fill out the form if I don't know
how your name is written."
"I apologize."
"Do you have any family?"
"Nakata's all alone. I have no family. And no job. I live on a sub city from the
Governor."
"It's pretty late, and I suggest you go on home. Go home and get a good night's
sleep, and then tomorrow if you remember something come and see me again. We can
talk then."
The policeman was nearing the end of his shift and wanted to finish up all his
paperwork before he went off duty. He'd promised to meet a fellow officer for a drink at
a nearby bar when he got off, so the last thing he wanted to do was waste time talking to
some crazy old coot.
But Nakata gave him a harsh look and shook his head. "No, sir, Nakata wants to
tell everything while he still remembers it. If I wait until tomorrow I might forget
something important. Nakata was in the empty lot in the 2-chome section. The Koizumis
had asked me to find their missing cat, Goma. Then a huge black dog suddenly appeared
and took me to a house. A big house with a big gate and a black car. I don't know the
address. I've never been to that part of town before. But I'm pretty sure it's in Nakano
Ward. Inside the house was a man named Johnnie Walker who had on a funny kind of
black hat. A very high sort of hat. Inside the refrigerator in the kitchen there were rows
of cats' heads. About twenty or so, I'd say. He collects cats, cuts off their heads with a
saw, and eats their hearts. He's collecting the cats' souls to make a special kind of flute.
And then he's going to use that flute to collect people's souls. Right in front of Nakata,
Johnnie Walker killed Mr. Kawamura with a knife. And several other cats. He cut open
their stomachs with a knife. He was going to kill Goma and Mimi, too. But then Nakata
used a knife to kill Johnnie Walker.
"Johnnie Walker said he wanted Nakata to kill him. But I didn't plan to kill him.
I've never killed anybody before. I just wanted to stop Johnnie Walker from killing any
more cats. But my body wouldn't listen. It did what it wanted. I picked up one of the
knives there and stabbed Johnnie Walker two times. Johnnie Walker fell down, all
covered with blood, and died. Nakata got all bloody then, too. I sat down over on the
sofa and must have fallen asleep. When I woke up it was the middle of the night and I
was back in the empty lot. Mimi and Goma were beside me. That was just a little while
ago. Nakata took Goma back, got some grilled eggplant and vinegared cucumbers from
Mrs. Koizumi, and came directly here. And I thought I'd better report to the Governor
right away. Tell him what happened."
Nakata sat up straight through this whole recitation, and when he'd finished he
took a deep breath. He'd never spoken this much in one spurt in his life. He felt
completely drained. "So please report this to the Governor," he added.
The young policeman had listened to the entire story with a vacant look, and
didn't understand much of what the old man was getting at. Goma? Johnnie Walker? "I
understand," he replied. "I'll make sure the Governor hears of this."
"I hope he doesn't cut off my sub city."
Looking displeased, the policeman pretended to fill out a form. "I understand. I'll
write it down just like that: The person in question desires that his subsidy not be cut off.
Is that all right then?"
"Yes, that's fine. Much obliged. Sorry to take your time. And please say hello to
the Governor for me."
"Will do. So don't worry, and just take it easy today, okay?" the policeman said.
He couldn't help adding a personal aside: "You know, your clothes look pretty clean for
having killed someone and gotten all bloody. There's not a spot on you."
"Yes, you're entirely correct. To tell the truth, Nakata finds it very strange too. It
doesn't make any sense. I should be covered in blood, but when I looked it had all
disappeared. It's very strange."
"It certainly is," the policeman said, his voice tinged with an entire day's worth of
exhaustion.
Nakata slid the door open and was about to leave when he stopped and turned
around. "Excuse me, sir, but will you be in this area tomorrow evening?"
"Yes, I will," the policeman replied cautiously. "I'm on duty here tomorrow
evening. Why do you ask?"
"Even if it's sunny, I suggest you bring an umbrella."
The policeman nodded. He turned and looked at the clock. His colleague should
be phoning any minute now. "Okay, I'll be sure to bring one."
"There will be fish falling from the sky, just like rain. A lot of fish. Mostly
sardines, I believe. With a few mackerel mixed in."
"Sardines and mackerel, huh?" the policeman laughed. "Better turn the umbrella
upside down, then, and catch a few. Could vinegar some for a meal."
"Vinegared mackerel's one of Nakata's favorites," Nakata said with a serious look.
"But by that time tomorrow I believe I'll be gone."
The next day when--sure enough--sardines and mackerel rained down on a
section of Nakano Ward, the young policeman turned white as a sheet. With no warning
whatsoever some two thousand sardines and mackerel plunged to earth from the clouds.
Most of the fish were crushed to a pulp as they slammed into the ground, but a few
survived and flopped around on the road in front of the shopping district. The fish were
fresh, still with a smell of the sea about them. The fish struck people, cars, and roofs, but
not, apparently, from a great height, so no serious injuries resulted. It was more
shocking than anything else. A huge number of fish falling like hail from the sky--it was
positively apocalyptic.
The police investigated the matter but could come up with no good explanation
for how it happened. No fish market or fishing boat reported any large number of
sardines and mackerel missing. No planes or helicopters were flying overhead at the
time. Neither were there any reports of tornados. They dismissed the possibility it was
some elaborate practical joke--who would possibly do something so utterly bizarre? At
the request of the police, the Nakano Ward Health Office collected some of the fish and
examined them, but found nothing unusual. They were just ordinary sardines and
mackerel. Fresh--and good to eat, by the looks of them. Still, the police, afraid these
mystery fish might contain some dangerous substance, sent out a loudspeaker truck
around the neighborhood warning people not to eat any.
This was the kind of story TV news shows lapped up, and crews rushed to the
scene. Reporters crowded around the shopping district and sent out their reports on this
curious event across the nation. The reporters scooped up fish with their shovels to
illustrate what had happened. They also interviewed a housewife who had been struck
on the head by one of the falling mackerel, the dorsal fin cutting her cheek. "I'm just
glad it wasn't a tuna," she said, pressing a handkerchief to her cheek. That made sense,
but still viewers chuckled. One of the more adventuresome reporters grilled some of the
fish on the spot. "Delicious," he told viewers proudly. "Very fresh, with just the right
amount of fat. Too bad I don't have any grated radish and hot rice to round out the
meal."
The policeman was baffled. The strange old codger--what was his name again?--
had predicted all these fish raining down from the sky. Sardines and mackerel, just like
he'd said.... But I just laughed it off, the policeman thought, and didn't even get his name
and address. Should he tell his boss about it? He supposed so, but then again what good
would it do now? Nobody really got hurt, and there wasn't any proof that a crime was
involved. Just a sudden squall of fish, raining from the sky.
But who's to say my boss would even believe me? he asked himself. Say I told
him the whole story--that the day before this happened a weird old guy stopped by the
police box and predicted there'd be a shower of fish. He'd think I've completely lost it.
And the story would make the rounds of the precinct, getting fishier with each retelling,
and end up as a running joke with him as the butt of it.
One more thing, the policeman thought. That old man had come to report that
he'd murdered somebody. To give himself up, in other words. And I never took him
seriously. Didn't even note it in the logbook. This was definitely against regulations, and
I could be brought up on charges. But the old man's story was so preposterous. No
policeman would ever take it seriously. It's a madhouse working the police box
sometimes, with paperwork up to here. The world's filled with people with a screw loose,
and, as if by agreement, at one time or another they all seem to find their way into police
boxes to blab out some nonsense. If you bother yourself with every one of these
nutcases, you'll go nuts yourself!
But that prediction about fish raining from the sky, a lunatic statement if there
ever was one, actually did happen, so maybe--just maybe--that story he told about
knifing somebody to death--Johnnie Walker, as he put it--might actually be true.
Assuming it was, this was a major problem, for he'd turned away someone confessing to
murder and didn't even write up a report on it.
Finally a garbage truck came and cleaned up all the mounds of fish. The young
policeman directed traffic, blocking off the entrance to the shopping district so cars
couldn't come in. Fish scales were stuck to the street in front of the shops and wouldn't
come off no matter how much they were hosed down. The street remained wet for some
time, causing a couple of housewives on bicycles to slip and fall. The place reeked of
fish for days afterward, getting the neighborhood cats all worked up. The policeman was
kept busy with the cleanup and didn't have time to think any more about the strange old
man.
The day after it rained fish, though, the policeman gulped in shock when the body
of a man, stabbed to death, was discovered nearby. The dead man was a famous sculptor,
and his body was discovered by the cleaning woman who came every other day. The
body was naked, lying in a pool of blood. Estimated time of death was in the evening
two days previous, the murder weapon a steak knife from the kitchen. To his dismay, the
young policeman finally believed what the old man had told him. My God, he thought,
what a complete mess I've gotten myself into! I should have called up the precinct and
taken the old man in. He confessed to murder, so I should've handed him over to the
higher-ups and let them decide if he's crazy or not. But I shirked my duty. Now that it's
come to this, the young policeman decided, the best thing to do is to just clam up and
pretend it never happened.
But by this time, Nakata was no longer in town.
Chapter 19
It's Monday and the library's closed. The library is quiet enough most of the time, but on
a day like this when it's closed it's like the land that time forgot. Or more like a place
that's holding its breath, hoping time won't stumble upon it.
Down the corridor from the reading room, past a STAFF ONLY sign, there's a
sink area where you can make coffee or tea, and there's a microwave oven, too. Just past
this is the door to the guest room, which includes a barebones bathroom and closet. Next
to the single bed is a nightstand outfitted with a reading lamp and alarm clock. There's
also a little writing desk with a lamp on it. Plus an old-fashioned set of chairs, covered
in white cloth, for receiving guests, and a chest for clothes. On top of a small, bachelorsize
refrigerator are some dishes and a small shelf for stowing them away. If you feel
like making a simple meal, the sink area's right outside. The bathroom's outfitted with a
shower, soap and shampoo, a hair dryer, and towels. Everything you need for a
comfortable short stay. Through a west-facing window you can see the trees in the
garden. It's getting close to evening, and the sinking sun glints past the cedar branches.
"I've stayed here a couple of times when it was too much trouble to go home,"
Oshima says. "But nobody else uses the room. As far as I know, Miss Saeki never uses
it. It's not going to put anybody out, your staying here, is what I'm trying to say."
I set my backpack on the floor and look around my new lodgings.
"There's a clean set of sheets, and enough in the fridge to tide you over. Milk,
some fruit, vegetables, butter, ham, cheese... Not enough for a decent meal, but enough
for a sandwich or salad at least. If you want something more, I suggest takeout, or going
out to eat. For laundry you'll have to make do with rinsing things out in the bathroom,
I'm afraid. Let's see, have I forgotten anything?"
"Where does Miss Saeki usually work?"
Oshima points to the ceiling. "You remember that room on the second floor you
saw on the tour? She's always there, writing. If I have to go out for a while she
sometimes comes downstairs and takes over at the counter. But unless she's got
something to do on the first floor, that's where you'll find her."
I nod.
"I'll be here tomorrow before ten to run through what your job involves. Until
then, just relax and take it easy."
"Thanks for everything," I tell him.
"My pleasure," he replies.
After he leaves I unload my backpack. Arrange my meager assortment of clothes
in the dresser, hang up my shirts and jacket, line up my notebook and pens on the desk,
put my toiletries in the bathroom, and finally stow the pack itself in the closet.
The room doesn't have any decorations at all, except for a small oil painting, a
realistic portrait of a young boy by the shore. Not bad, I decide--maybe done by
somebody famous? The boy looks about twelve or so, and he's wearing a white sunhat
and sitting on a small deck chair. His elbow's on one of the arms of the chair, his chin
resting in his hand. He looks a little sad, but kind of pleased, too. A black German
shepherd sits next to the boy, like he's guarding him. In the background is the sea and a
couple of other people, but they're too far away to make out their faces. A small island's
visible, and a few fist-shaped clouds float over the water. Most definitely a summer
scene. I sit down at the desk and gaze at the painting for a while. I start to feel like I can
hear the crash of waves, the salty smell of the sea.
The boy in the painting might be the boy who used to live in this room, the young
man Miss Saeki loved. The one who got caught up in the student movement clashes and
was pointlessly beaten to death. There's no saying for sure, but I'm betting that's who it
is. The scenery looks a lot like what you see around here, for one thing. If that's the case,
then it must be from about forty years ago--an eternity to somebody like me. I try
imagining myself in forty years, but it's like trying to picture what lies beyond the
universe.
The next morning Oshima arrives and shows me what I'm supposed to do to get
the library ready to open. First I have to unlock and open the windows to air out the
rooms, make a quick pass with the vacuum cleaner, wipe the desktops, change the
flowers in the vases, turn on the lights, occasionally sprinkle water in the garden to keep
down the dust, and, when the time comes, open the door. At closing time it's the same
procedure in reverse--lock the windows, wipe the desktops again, turn off the lights, and
close the front door.
"There's not much for anybody to steal here, so maybe we don't need to be so
worried about always locking the door," Oshima tells me. "But Miss Saeki and I don't
like things done sloppily. So we try to do things by the book. This is our house, so we
treat it with respect. And I hope you'll do the same."
I nod.
Next he shows me what to do at the reception desk, how to help out people
coming to use the library.
"For the time being you should just sit next to me and watch what I do. It's not all
that hard. If something ever comes up you can't handle, just go upstairs and ask Miss
Saeki. She'll take care of it."
Miss Saeki shows up just before eleven. Her Volkswagen Golf makes a
distinctive roar as it pulls up, and I can tell right away it's her. She parks, comes in
through the back door, and greets the two of us. "Morning," she says. "Good morning,"
we answer back. That's the extent of our conversation. Miss Saeki has on a navy blue
short-sleeved dress, a cotton coat in her arms, a shoulder bag. Nothing you could call an
accessory, and hardly a hint of makeup. Still, there's something about her that's dazzling.
She glances at me standing next to Oshima and looks for a moment like she wants to say
something, but doesn't. She merely beams a slight smile in my direction and walks up to
her office on the second floor.
"Not to worry," Oshima assures me. "She has no problem with your being here.
She just doesn't go in for a lot of small talk, that's all."
At eleven Oshima and I open up the main door, but nobody comes for a while.
During the interval he shows me how to use the computers to search for books. They're
typical library PCs I'm already familiar with. Next he shows me how to arrange all the
catalog cards. Every day the library receives copies of newly published books, and one
of the other tasks is to log in these new arrivals by hand.
Around eleven-thirty two women come in together, wearing identical jeans. The
shorter of the two has cropped hair like a swimmer, while the taller woman wears her
hair pulled back. Both of them have on jogging shoes, one a pair of Nikes, the other
Asics. The tall one looks around forty or so, with glasses and a checked shirt, the shorter
woman, a decade younger, is wearing a white blouse. Both have little daypacks on, and
expressions as gloomy as a cloudy day. Neither one says very much. Oshima relieves
them of their packs at the entrance, and the women, looking displeased, extract
notebooks and pens before leaving them.
The women go through the library, checking the stacks one by one, earnestly
flipping through the card catalog, occasionally taking notes. They don't read anything or
sit down. They act less like people using a library than inspectors from the tax office
checking a company's inventory. Oshima and I can't figure out who they are or what
they could possibly be up to. He gives me a significant look and shrugs. To put it mildly,
I don't have a good feeling about this.
At noon, while Oshima goes out to the garden to eat his lunch, I fill in for him
behind the counter.
"Excuse me, but I have a question," one of the women comes over and says. The
tall one. Her tone of voice is hard and unyielding, like a loaf of bread someone forgot on
the back of a shelf.
"Yes, what can I do for you?"
She frowns and looks at me like I'm some off-kilter picture frame. "Aren't you a
high school student?"
"Yes, that's right. I'm a trainee," I answer.
"Is there one of your superiors I could talk to?"
I go out to the garden to get Oshima. He slowly takes a sip of coffee to dissolve
the bite of food in his mouth, brushes the crumbs from his lap, and comes inside.
"Yes, may I help you?" Oshima asks her amiably.
"Just to let you know, we're investigating public cultural facilities in the entire
country from a woman's point of view, looking at ease of use, fair access, and other
issues," she says. "Our group is doing a yearlong investigation and plans to publish a
public report on our findings. A large number of women are involved in this project, and
the two of us happen to be in charge of this region."
"If you don't mind," Oshima says, "would you tell me the name of this
organization?"
The woman whips out a business card and passes it to him.
His expression unchanged, Oshima reads it carefully, places it on the counter,
then looks up with a blazing smile and gazes intently at the woman. A first-class smile
guaranteed to make any red-blooded woman blush.
This woman, strangely enough, doesn't react, not even a twitch of an eyebrow.
"What we've concluded is that, unfortunately, this library has several issues that need to
be addressed."
"From the viewpoint of women, is what you're saying," Oshima commented.
"Correct, from the viewpoint of women," the woman answers. She clears her
throat. "And we'd like to bring this up with your administration and hear their response,
so if you don't mind?"
"We don't have something as fancy as an administration, but I would be happy to
listen to you."
"Well, first of all you have no restroom set aside for women. That's correct, isn't
it?"
"Yes, that's right. There's no women's restroom in this library. We have one
restroom for both men and women."
"Even if you are a private facility, since you're open to the public don't you think-
-in principle--that you should provide separate restrooms for men and women?"
"In principle?" Oshima says.
"Correct. Shared facilities give rise to all sorts of harassment. According to our
survey, the majority of women are reluctant to use shared bathrooms. This is a clear case
of neglect of your female patrons."
"Neglect...," Oshima says, and makes a face like he's swallowed something bitter
by mistake. He doesn't much like the sound of the word, it would seem.
"An intentional oversight."
"Intentional oversight," he repeats, and gives some thought to this clumsy phrase.
"So what is your reaction to all this?" the woman asks, barely containing her
irritation.
"As you can see," Oshima says, "we're a very small library. And unfortunately we
don't have the space for separate restrooms. Naturally it would be better to have separate
facilities, but none of our patrons have ever complained. For better or for worse, our
library doesn't get very crowded. If you'd like to pursue this issue of separate restrooms
further, I suggest you go to the Boeing headquarters in Seattle and address the issue of
restrooms on 747s. A 747's much bigger than our little library, and much more crowded.
As far as I'm aware, all restrooms on passenger jets are shared by men and women."
The tall woman frowns at him severely, her cheekbones jutting forward and her
glasses riding up her nose. "We are not investigating airplanes .747s are beside the
point."
"Wouldn't restrooms in both jets and in our library--in principle--give rise to the
same sorts of problems?"
"We are investigating, one by one, public facilities. We're not here to argue over
principles."
Oshima's supple smile never fades during this exchange. "Is that so? I could have
sworn that principles were exactly what we were discussing."
The woman realizes she's blown it. She blushes a bit, though not because of
Oshima's sex appeal. She tries a different tack. "At any rate, jumbo jets are irrelevant
here. Don't try to confuse the issue."
"Understood. No more airplanes," Oshima promises. "We'll bring things down to
earth."
The woman glares at him and, after taking a breath, forges on. "One other issue
I'd like to raise is how you have authors here separated by sex."
"Yes, that's right. The person who was in charge before us cataloged these and for
whatever reason divided them into male and female. We were thinking of recataloging
all of them, but haven't been able to as of yet."
"We're not criticizing you for this," she says.
Oshima tilts his head slightly.
"The problem, though, is that in all categories male authors are listed before
female authors," she says. "To our way of thinking this violates the principle of sexual
equality and is totally unfair."
Oshima picks up her business card again, runs his eyes over it, then lays it back
down on the counter. "Ms. Soga," he begins, "when they called the role in school your
name would have come before Ms. Tanaka, and after Ms. Sekine. Did you file a
complaint about that? Did you object, asking them to reverse the order? Does G get
angry because it follows F in the alphabet? Does page 68 in a book start a revolution just
because it follows 67?"
"That's not the point," she says angrily. "You're intentionally trying to confuse the
issue."
Hearing this, the shorter woman, who'd been standing in front of a stack taking
notes, races over.
"Intentionally trying to confuse the issue," Oshima repeats, like he's underlining
the woman's words.
"Are you denying it?"
"That's a red herring," Oshima replies.
The woman named Soga stands there, mouth slightly ajar, not saying a word.
"In English there's this expression red herring. Something that's very interesting
but leads you astray from the main topic. I'm afraid I haven't looked into why they use
that kind of expression, though."
"Herrings or mackerel or whatever, you're dodging the issue."
"Actually what I'm doing is shifting the analogy," Oshima says. "One of the most
effective methods of argument, according to Aristotle. The citizens of ancient Athens
enjoyed using this kind of intellectual trick very much. It's a shame, though, that at the
time women weren't included in the definition of 'citizen.'"
"Are you making fun of us?"
Oshima shakes his head. "Look, what I'm trying to get across is this: I'm sure
there are many more effective ways of making sure that Japanese women's rights are
guaranteed than sniffing around a small library in a little town and complaining about
the restrooms and the card catalog. We're doing our level best to see that this modest
library of ours helps the community. We've assembled an outstanding collection for
people who love books. And we do our utmost to put a human face on all our dealings
with the public. You might not be aware of it, but this library's collection of poetryrelated
material from the 1910s to the mid-Showa period is nationally recognized. Of
course there are things we could do better, and limits to what we can accomplish. But
rest assured we're doing our very best. I think it'd be a whole lot better if you focus on
what we do well than what we're unable to do. Isn't that what you call fair?"
The tall woman looks at the short one, who looks back up at her and opens her
mouth for the first time. "You've just been evading the point, mouthing empty
arguments that avoid taking responsibility," she says in a really high-pitched voice. "In
reality, to use the term for the sake of convenience, what you're doing is an easygoing
attempt at self-justification. You are a totally pathetic, historical example of the
phallocentric, to put it mildly."
"A pathetic, historical example," Oshima repeats, obviously impressed. By his
tone of voice he seems to like the sound of that phrase.
"In other words you're a typical sexist, patriarchic male," the tall one pipes in,
unable to conceal her irritation.
"A patriarchic male," Oshima again repeats.
The short one ignores this and goes on. "You're employing the status quo and the
cheap phallocentric logic that supports it to reduce the entire female gender to secondclass
citizens, to limit and deprive women of the rights they're due. You're doing this
unconsciously rather than deliberately, but that makes you even guiltier. You protect
vested male interests and become inured to the pain of others, and don't even try to see
what evil your blindness causes women and society. I realize that problems with
restrooms and card catalogs are mere details, but if we don't begin with the small things
we'll never be able to throw off the cloak of blindness that covers our society. Those are
the principles by which we act."
"That's the way every sensible woman feels," the tall one adds, her face
expressionless.
"How could any woman of generous spirit behave otherwise, given the torments
that I face," Oshima says.
The two women stand there as silent as icebergs.
"Electra, by Sophocles. A wonderful play. And by the way, the term gender was
originally used to indicate grammatical gender. My feeling is the word 'sex' is more
accurate in terms of indicating physical sexual difference. Using 'gender' here is
incorrect. To put a linguistic fine point on it."
A frozen silence follows.
"At any rate, what you've been saying is fundamentally wrong," Oshima says,
calmly yet emphatically. "I am most definitely not a pathetic, historical example of a
patriarchic male."
"Then explain, simply, what's wrong with what we've said," the shorter woman
says defiantly.
"Without sidestepping the issue or trying to show off how erudite you are," the
tall one adds.
"All right. I'll do just that--explain it simply and honestly, minus any sidestepping
or displays of brilliance," Oshima says.
"We're waiting," the tall one says, and the short one gives a compact nod to show
she agrees.
"First of all, I'm not a male," Oshima announces.
A dumbfounded silence follows on the part of everybody. I gulp and shoot
Oshima a glance.
"I'm a woman," he says.
"I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't joke around," the short woman says, after a
pause for breath. Not much confidence, though. It's more like she felt somebody had to
say something.
Oshima pulls his wallet out of his chinos, takes out the driver's license, and passes
it to the woman. She reads what's written there, frowns, and hands it to her tall
companion, who reads it and, after a moment's hesitation, gives it back to Oshima, a
sour look on her face.
"Did you want to see it too?" Oshima asks me. When I shake my head, he slips
the license back in his wallet and puts the wallet in his pants pocket. He then places both
hands on the counter and says, "As you can see, biologically and legally I am
undeniably female. Which is why what you've been saying about me is fundamentally
wrong. It's simply impossible for me to be, as you put it, a typical sexist, patriarchic
male."
"Yes, but--" the tall woman says but then stops. The short one, lips tight, is
playing with her collar.
"My body is physically female, but my mind's completely male," Oshima goes on.
"Emotionally I live as a man. So I suppose your notion of being a historical example
may be correct. And maybe I am sexist--who knows. But I'm not a lesbian, even though
I dress this way. My sexual preference is for men. In other words, I'm a female but I'm
gay. I do anal sex, and have never used my vagina for sex. My clitoris is sensitive but
my breasts aren't. I don't have a period. So, what am I discriminating against? Could
somebody tell me?"
The three of us listening are flabbergasted and don't say a word. One of the
women clears her throat, and the jarring sound reverberates through the room. The clock
on the wall loudly ticks away the seconds.
"I'm very sorry," Oshima says, "but I'm in the middle of lunch. I'm having a tunaspinach
wrap and had eaten half of it when you asked me over. If I leave it much longer
the neighborhood cats will make a grab for it. People throw away kittens they don't want
in the woods near the sea, so this neighborhood is full of cats. If you don't mind I'd like
to get back to my lunch. So excuse me, but please take your time and enjoy the library.
Our library is open to everyone. As long as you follow the rules and don't bother the
other patrons, feel free to do whatever you'd like. You can look at whatever you want.
Go ahead and write whatever you like in your report. We won't mind. We don't receive
any funding from anywhere and pretty much do things our own way. And that's the way
we like it."
After Oshima leaves the two women share a look, then they both stare at me.
Maybe they figure me for Oshima's lover or something. I don't say a word and start
arranging catalog cards. The two of them whisper to each other in the stacks, and before
long they gather their belongings and start to pull up stakes. Frozen looks on their faces,
they don't say a word of thanks when I hand back their daypacks.
After a while Oshima finishes his lunch and comes back inside. He hands me two
spinach wraps made of tuna and vegetables wrapped in a kind of green tortilla with a
white cream sauce on top. I have these for lunch. I boil up some water and have a cup of
Earl Grey to wash it down.
"Everything I said a while ago is true," Oshima tells me when I come back from
lunch.
"So that's what you meant when you told me you were a special person?"
"I wasn't trying to brag or anything," he says, "but you understand that I wasn't
exaggerating, right?"
I nod silently.
Oshima smiles. "In terms of sex I'm most definitely female, though my breasts
haven't developed much and I've never had a period. But I don't have a penis or testicles
or facial hair. In short, I have nothing. A nice no-extra-baggage kind of feeling, if you
want to put a positive spin on it. Though I doubt you can understand how that feels."
"I guess not," I say.
"Sometimes I don't understand it myself. Like, what the heck am I, anyway?
Really, what am I?"
I shake my head. "Well, I don't know what I am, either."
"A classic identity crisis."
I nod.
"But at least you know where to begin. Unlike me."
"I don't care what you are. Whatever you are, I like you," I tell him. I've never
said this to anybody in my whole life, and the words make me blush.
"I appreciate it," Oshima says, and lays a gentle hand on my shoulder. "I know
I'm a little different from everyone else, but I'm still a human being. That's what I'd like
you to realize. I'm just a regular person, not some monster. I feel the same things
everyone else does, act the same way. Sometimes, though, that small difference feels
like an abyss. But I guess there's not much I can do about it." He picks up a long,
sharpened pencil from the counter and gazes at it like it's an extension of himself. "I
wanted to tell you all this as soon as I could, directly, rather than have you hear it from
someone else. So I guess today was a good opportunity. It wasn't such a pleasant
experience, though, was it?"
I nod.
"I've experienced all kinds of discrimination," Oshima says. "Only people who've
been discriminated against can really know how much it hurts. Each person feels the
pain in his own way, each has his own scars. So I think I'm as concerned about fairness
and justice as anybody. But what disgusts me even more are people who have no
imagination. The kind T. S. Eliot calls hollow men. People who fill up that lack of
imagination with heartless bits of straw, not even aware of what they're doing. Callous
people who throw a lot of empty words at you, trying to force you to do what you don't
want to. Like that lovely pair we just met." He sighs and twirls the long slender pencil in
his hand. "Gays, lesbians, straights, feminists, fascist pigs, communists, Hare Krishnas--
none of them bother me. I don't care what banner they raise. But what I can't stand are
hollow people. When I'm with them I just can't bear it, and wind up saying things I
shouldn't. With those women--I should've just let it slide, or else called Miss Saeki and
let her handle it. She would have given them a smile and smoothed things over. But I
just can't do that. I say things I shouldn't, do things I shouldn't do. I can't control myself.
That's one of my weak points. Do you know why that's a weak point of mine?"
"'Cause if you take every single person who lacks much imagination seriously,
there's no end to it," I say.
"That's it," Oshima says. He taps his temple lightly with the eraser end of the
pencil. "But there's one thing I want you to remember, Kafka. Those are exactly the kind
of people who murdered Miss Saeki's childhood sweetheart. Narrow minds devoid of
imagination. Intolerance, theories cut off from reality, empty terminology, usurped
ideals, inflexible systems. Those are the things that really frighten me. What I absolutely
fear and loathe. Of course it's important to know what's right and what's wrong.
Individual errors in judgment can usually be corrected. As long as you have the courage
to admit mistakes, things can be turned around. But intolerant, narrow minds with no
imagination are like parasites that transform the host, change form, and continue to
thrive. They're a lost cause, and I don't want anyone like that coming in here."
Oshima points at the stacks with the tip of his pencil. What he means, of course,
is the entire library.
"I wish I could just laugh off people like that, but I can't."
Chapter 20
It was already past eight p. m. when the eighteen-wheeler refrigerated truck pulled off
the Tomei Highway and let Nakata out in the parking lot of the Fujigawa rest area.
Canvas bag and umbrella in hand, he clambered down from the passenger seat to the
asphalt.
"Good luck in finding another ride," the driver said, his head sticking out the
window. "If you ask around, I'm sure you'll find something."
"Much obliged. Nakata appreciates all your help."
"Take it easy," the driver said, then waved and pulled back onto the highway.
Fu-ji-ga-wa, the driver had said. Nakata had no idea where Fu-ji-ga-wa was,
though he did understand he'd left Tokyo and was heading west. No need for a compass
or a map to tell him that, he knew it instinctively. Now if only a truck going west would
give him a ride.
Nakata was hungry and decided to have a bowl of ramen in the rest area
restaurant. The rice balls and chocolate in his bag he wanted to save for an emergency.
Not being able to read, it took him a while to figure out how to purchase a meal. Before
going into the dining hall you had to buy meal tickets from a vending machine, but he
had to have somebody help him read the buttons. "My eyes are bad, so I can't see too
well," he told a middle-aged woman, and she inserted the money for him, pushed the
right button, and handed him his change. Experience had taught him it was better not to
let on that he didn't know how to read. Because when he did, people stared at him like
he was some kind of monster.
After his meal, Nakata, umbrella in hand, bag slung over his shoulder, made the
rounds of the trucks in the parking lot, asking for a ride. I'm heading west, he explained,
and I wonder if you'd be kind enough to give me a ride? But the drivers all took one
look at him and shook their heads. An elderly hitchhiker was pretty unusual, and they
were naturally wary of anything out of the ordinary. Our company doesn't allow us to
pick up hitchhikers, they all said. Sorry.
It had taken a long time to make it from Nakano Ward to the entrance to the
Tomei Highway. He'd never been out of Nakano before, and had no idea where the
highway was. He had a special pass for the city bus line he could use, but he'd never
ridden by himself on the subway or train, where you needed to buy a ticket.
It was just before ten a. m. when he packed a change of clothes, a toilet kit, and
some snacks in his bag, carefully put the cash he'd hidden under the tatami in a money
belt for safekeeping, and then, the large umbrella in hand, left his apartment. When he
asked the city bus driver how he could get to the highway, the man laughed.
"This bus only goes to Shinjuku Station. City buses don't go on the highway.
You'll have to take a highway bus."
"Where can I get a highway bus that goes on the To-mei Highway?"
"Tokyo Station," the driver replied. "Take this bus to Shinjuku Station, then take
a train to Tokyo Station, where you can buy a reserved-seat ticket. The buses there will
take you to the Tomei Highway."
Nakata wasn't at all sure what he meant, but went ahead and took the bus as far as
Shinjuku. But when he got there he was overwhelmed. The massive station was jammed
with people, and he had trouble moving through the crowds. There were so many train
lines, too, that he couldn't figure out which one went to Tokyo Station. Since he couldn't
read the signs, he asked a few passersby, but their explanations were too fast, too
complicated, and full of place-names he didn't recognize. I might as well be talking to
Kawamura, Nakata thought to himself. There was always a police box to ask directions
at, but he was afraid they'd mistake him for a senile old person and take him into
custody, something he'd experienced once before. As he wandered around near the
station the exhaust and noise got to him and he started to feel sick. Avoiding the
crowded sidewalks, he found a small park set between two high-rise buildings and sat
down on a bench.
Nakata was at a complete loss. He sat there, muttering occasionally, rubbing the
top of his close-cropped head. There wasn't a cat to be seen in the park. There were
plenty of crows, though, squawking down and rummaging through the trash baskets.
Nakata looked up at the sky a few times, and from the sun's position could guess the
approximate time. Because of all the exhaust, perhaps, the sky was covered in a strange
color.
At noon, office workers from the nearby buildings flooded out to eat lunch in the
park. Nakata ate the bean-jam buns he'd brought with him, washing them down with hot
tea from his thermos. Two young women sat down together on the bench besides his,
and he decided to talk to them. How can I get to the To-mei Highway? he asked. They
told him the same thing the city bus driver had said. Take the Chuo Line to Tokyo
Station, then a Tomei Highway bus.
"Nakata tried that but it didn't work," Nakata admitted. "I've never been out of
Nakano Ward before. So I don't know how to take the train. I just know how to ride the
city bus. I can't read, so I can't buy a ticket. I took the city bus here, but don't know how
to go any farther."
You can't read?! they asked, astonished. He seemed like a harmless enough old
man. A nice smile, dressed neatly. Carrying an umbrella on such a fine day like this was
a bit odd, but he didn't appear to be homeless. A pleasant face, especially those brightlooking
eyes.
"You really mean to say you've never been outside Nakano Ward?" the girl with
black hair asked.
"Yes. I've tried not to ever go out of it. If Nakata got lost, there's nobody who'd
come looking for me."
"And you can't read," said the other girl, the one with dyed brownish hair.
"That's right. I can't read at all. I can understand simple numbers, but can't add."
"Hmm. I imagine it would be hard for you to take a train."
"Yes, it's very hard. I can't buy a ticket."
"If we had time we could take you to the station and make sure you get on the
right train, but we have to get back to work soon. I'm really sorry."
"No, no need to apologize. I'll figure it out somehow."
"I've got it!" the girl with black hair exclaimed. "Didn't Togeguchi over in sales
say he had to go to Yokohama today?"
"Yes, now that you mention it. He'd help out if we asked him. He's a little on the
gloomy side, but not a bad guy, really," the brown-haired girl said.
"Since you can't read, maybe it'd be better to hitchhike," the black-haired girl said.
"Hitchhike?"
"Ask for a ride from somebody. Mostly it ends up being rides with long-haul
truckers. Regular cars don't pick up hitchhikers much."
"Nakata's not sure what long-haul truckers are."
"As long as you go there it'll work out. I hitchhiked once when I was in college.
Truck drivers are all nice guys."
"How far are you going on the Tomei Highway?" the brown-haired girl asked.
"Nakata doesn't know," Nakata replied.
"You don't know?"
"I'll know when I get there. So I'll start out going west on the To-mei Highway.
After that I'll think about where I'll go. Anyhow, I have to go west."
The two girls looked at each other, but Nakata's words were strangely persuasive
and they found themselves feeling kindly toward the old man. They finished their
lunches, tossed their empty cans in the trash, and stood up.
"Why don't you come with us?" the black-haired girl said. "We'll figure
something out."
Nakata followed them into a nearby building. He'd never been in such a large
building before. The two girls had him sit at a bench next to the reception desk, then
spoke with the receptionist and told Nakata to wait there for a while. They disappeared
into one of the elevator banks in the lobby. As Nakata sat there, umbrella and canvas
bag in hand, office workers streamed back inside after their lunch hour. Another scene
he'd never laid eyes on before in his life. As if by mutual consent, all the people were
well dressed--ties, shiny briefcases, and high heels, everyone rushing off in the same
direction. For the life of him Nakata couldn't understand what so many people like this
could possibly be up to.
After a time the two girls were back, acccompanied by a gangly young man
wearing a white shirt and striped tie.
"This is Mr. Togeguchi," the brown-haired girl said. "He's about to drive to
Yokohama. And he said he'll take you with him. He'll drop you at the Kohoku parking
lot on the Tomei Highway, and hopefully you'll be able to find another ride there. Just
go around telling people you want to go west, and when someone gives you a ride be
sure to buy them a meal when you stop somewhere. Do you follow?"
"But do you have enough money for that?" the black-haired one asked.
"Yes, I have enough."
"Mr. Nakata's a friend of ours, so be nice to him," the brown-haired girl said to
Togeguchi.
"If you'll be nice to me," the young man replied timidly.
"One of these days...," the black-haired one said.
As they were saying good-bye, the girls said, "Here's a little going-away present.
For when you get hungry." They handed him some rice balls and a bar of chocolate
they'd bought at a convenience store.
"I don't know how to thank you enough for all you've done," Nakata said. "I'll be
praying that good things happen to you both."
"I hope your prayers come true," the brown-haired one said as her companion
giggled.
The young man, Togeguchi, had Nakata sit in the passenger seat of the Hi-Ace
van, then drove down the Metropolitan Highway and onto the Tomei. The roads were
backed up, so the two of them talked about all kinds of things as they inched along.
Togeguchi was bashful, and didn't say much at first, but after he got used to having
Nakata with him he started talking, to the point where it wound up less a conversation
than a running monologue. There were a lot of things he wanted to talk about, and he
found it easy to open up to a stranger like Nakata, whom he'd never see again. He
explained that he'd broken up with his fiancée a few months ago. She'd had another
boyfriend she'd been secretly seeing all the while. He said he didn't get along well with
his bosses at work and was thinking of quitting. His parents had gotten divorced when
he was in junior high, and his mother soon got remarried to some sleazeball. He'd lent
money from his savings to a friend who didn't give any indication he'd be repaying him
anytime soon. And the college student who lived in the apartment next door blasted his
music so loud he couldn't get much sleep.
Nakata listened diligently, chiming in at appropriate points, tossing in an
occasional opinion of his own. By the time their car pulled into the Kohoku parking area
Nakata knew just about everything there was to know about the young man. There was a
lot he didn't understand, but he did see the big picture of Togeguchi's life, namely that
here was a poor young guy who, while trying to live an upright life, had his share of
problems.
"Nakata's much obliged to you," he said. "Thank you so very much for the ride."
"I enjoyed it. Thanks to you, Mr. Nakata, I feel completely relaxed now. I've
never talked to anyone like this before, and I'm happy I could tell you everything. I hope
I haven't bored you with all my problems."
"No, not at all. Nakata's very happy, too, to be able to talk with you. I'm sure
good things are going to happen to you, Mr. Togeguchi."
The young man took a telephone card from his wallet and handed it to Nakata.
"Please take this card. My company makes them. Consider it a going-away present. I
wish I could give you something better."
"Thank you very much," Nakata said, and carefully tucked it into his wallet. He
had no one to phone, and didn't know how to use the card anyway, but he thought it was
more polite to accept it. By now it was three p. m.
It took another hour to find someone willing to take him as far as Fujigawa. The
trucker was a beefy man in his mid-forties, with arms like logs and a jutting belly, who
was hauling fresh fish in a refrigerated truck.
"I hope you don't mind the fish smell," the driver said.
"Fish are one of Nakata's favorites," Nakata replied.
The driver laughed. "You're a strange one, aren't you."
"People tell me that sometimes."
"I happen to like the strange ones," the driver said. "People who look normal and
live a normal life--they're the ones you have to watch out for."
"Is that so?"
"Believe me, that's how it goes. In my opinion, anyway."
"Nakata doesn't have many opinions. Though I do like eel."
"Well, that's an opinion. That you like eel."
"Eel is an opinion?"
"Sure, saying you like eel's an opinion."
Thus the two of them drove to Fujigawa. The driver said his name was Hagita.
"So, Mr. Nakata, what do you think about the way the world's going?" he asked.
"I'm very sorry, I'm not bright, so I have no idea at all about that," Nakata said.
"Having your own opinion and not being very bright are two different things."
"But Mr. Hagita, not being very bright means you can't think about things."
"But you did say you like eel."
"Yes, eel is one of Nakata's favorites."
"That's a connection, see?"
"Um."
"Do you like chicken and egg over rice?"
"Yes, that's one of Nakata's favorites too."
"Well, there's a connection there, too," Hagita said. "You build up relationships
like that one after another and before you know it you have meaning. The more
connections, the deeper the meaning. Doesn't matter if it's eel, or rice bowls, or grilled
fish, whatever. Get it?"
"No, I still don't understand. Does food make connections between things?"
"Not just food. Streetcars, the emperor, whatever."
"But I don't ride streetcars."
"That's fine. Look--what I'm getting at is no matter who or what you're dealing
with, people build up meaning between themselves and the things around them. The
important thing is whether this comes about naturally or not. Being bright has nothing to
do with it. What matters is that you see things with your own eyes."
"You're very bright, Mr. Hagita."
Hagita let out a loud laugh. "It isn't a question of intelligence. I'm not all that
bright, I just have my own way of thinking. That's why people get disgusted with me.
They accuse me of always bringing up things that are better left alone. If you try to use
your head to think about things, people don't want to have anything to do with you."
"Nakata still doesn't understand, but are you saying that there's a link between
liking eel and liking chicken and egg over rice?"
"You could put it that way, I suppose. There's always going to be a connection
between you, Mr. Nakata, and the things you deal with. Just like there's a connection
between eel and rice bowls. And as the web of these connections spreads out, a
relationship between you, Mr. Nakata, and capitalists and the proletariat naturally
develops."
"Pro-le-what?"
"The proletariat," Mr. Hagita said, taking his hands off the steering wheel and
making a wide gesture. To Nakata they looked as massive as baseball gloves. "The
people who work hard, who earn their bread through the sweat of their brow, those are
the proletariat. On the other hand you've got your guys who sit on their duffs, not lifting
a finger, giving orders to other people and getting a hundred times my salary. Those are
your capitalists."
"I don't know about people who are capitalists. I'm poor, and I don't know
anybody great like that. The greatest person I know is the Governor of Tokyo. Is the
Governor a capitalist?"
"Yeah, I suppose. Governors are more likely to be capitalists' lapdogs, though."
"The Governor is a dog?" Nakata remembered the huge black dog who took him
to Johnnie Walker's house, and that ominous figure and the Governor overlapped in his
mind.
"The world's swarming with those kind of dogs. Pawns of the capitalists."
"Pawns?"
"Like paws, with an 'n'."
"Are there any capitalist cats?" Nakata asked.
Hagita burst out laughing. "Boy, you are different, Mr. Nakata! But I like your
style. Capitalist cats! That's a good one. A very unique opinion you have there."
"Mr. Hagita?"
"Yeah?"
"I'm poor and received a sub city every month from the Governor. Was this the
wrong thing to do?"
"How much do you get every month?"
Nakata told him the amount.
Hagita shook his head disgustedly. "Pretty damn hard to get by on so little."
"That's not true, because Nakata doesn't use much money. Besides the sub city, I
get money by helping people find their lost cats."
"No kidding? A professional cat-finder?" Hagita said, impressed. "You're an
amazing guy, I have to say."
"Actually, I'm able to talk with cats," Nakata said. "I can understand what they
say. That helps me locate the missing ones."
Hagita nodded. "I wouldn't put it past you."
"But not long ago I found out I couldn't talk with cats anymore. I wonder why."
"Things change every day, Mr. Nakata. With each new dawn it's not the same
world as the day before. And you're not the same person you were, either. You get what
I'm saying?"
"Yes."
"Connections change too. Who's the capitalist, who's the proletarian. Who's on
the right, who's on the left. The information revolution, stock options, floating assets,
occupational restructuring, multinational corporations--what's good, what's bad.
Boundaries between things are disappearing all the time. Maybe that's why you can't
speak to cats anymore."
"The difference between right and left Nakata understands. This is right, and this
is left. Correct?"
"You got it," Hagita agreed. "That's all you need to know."
The last thing they did together was have a meal in a rest area restaurant. Hagita
ordered two orders of eel, and when Nakata insisted on paying, to thank him for the ride,
the driver shook his head emphatically.
"No way," he said. "I'd never let you use the pittance they give you for a subsidy
to feed me."
"Much obliged, then. Thank you for such a treat," Nakata said, happy to accept
his kindness.
Nakata spent an hour at the Fujigawa rest area asking drivers for a ride, but
couldn't find anyone willing to take him. He didn't start to panic, though, or get
depressed. In his mind, time passed very slowly. Or barely at all.
He went outside for some air and wandered around. The sky was cloudless, the
surface of the moon clearly visible. Nakata strolled around the parking lot, which was
filled with countless huge trucks, like giant beasts lined up shoulder to shoulder, resting.
Some of the trucks had at least twenty giant tires, each one as tall as a man. So many
trucks, all racing down the highway so late at night--what could they possibly be
carrying inside? Nakata couldn't imagine. If he could read the writing on the sides of the
trucks, he wondered, would he be able to figure it out?
After about an hour he spotted ten or so motorcycles parked in a corner of the lot
where there weren't many cars. A clump of young men stood nearby in a circle, looking
at something and yelling. Intrigued, Nakata approached them. Maybe they'd discovered
something unusual?
When he got closer he saw that they had surrounded someone lying on the ground
and were punching, kicking, and generally trying their best to hurt him. Most of the men
were unarmed, though one of them had a chain in his hand. Another held a black stick
that looked like a policeman's baton. They wore unbuttoned short-sleeved shirts, some in
T-shirts, others in running shirts, most of them with hair dyed blond or brown, some
with tattoos on their arms. The young man they were beating and kicking was dressed
much the same.
As Nakata approached, tapping the asphalt surface with the tip of his umbrella, a
couple of the men turned around and glared at him. They relaxed when they saw it was
just some harmless old man. "Why don't you beat it, Pops," one of them growled.
Unperturbed, Nakata walked over even closer. The man on the ground seemed to
be bleeding from his mouth. "Blood's coming out," Nakata said. "He might die."
Caught off guard, the men didn't react right away.
"Maybe we should kill you too, while we're at it," the one with the chain said.
"Killing one or two--no skin off my nose."
"You can't kill someone for no reason," Nakata insisted.
"You can't kill someone for no reason," one of them mimicked, and his friends
laughed.
"We got our reasons, pal," another man said. "And it ain't got nothin' to do with
you whether we kill him or not. So take your worthless umbrella and hit the road, before
it starts raining."
The man on the ground started crawling forward, and a young man with a shaved
head came over and kicked him hard in the ribs with his work boots.
Nakata closed his eyes. He could feel something welling up inside him, beyond
his control. He felt slightly nauseous. The memory of stabbing Johnnie Walker suddenly
came back to him. His hand still remembered what it felt like to plunge a knife into a
man's chest. Connections. Could this be one of those connections that Mr. Hagita was
talking about? Eel = knife = Johnnie Walker? The men's voices sounded distorted, and
he couldn't tell them apart anymore. Their voices blended together with the ceaseless
drone of tires from the highway to make a strange tone. His heart surged blood to his
extremities as night enveloped him.
Nakata looked up at the sky, then slowly opened his umbrella and held it over
him. Very carefully he took a few steps backward, opening a space between himself and
the gang. He looked around, then took a few more steps back.
The young men laughed when they saw this. "Hey, look at the cool old guy!" one
of them said. "He's actually using his umbrella!"
But they didn't laugh for long. Suddenly, unfamiliar greasy objects began to rain
down from the sky, striking the ground at their feet with a weird slap. The young men
stopped kicking their prey and looked up at the sky. There weren't any clouds, but things
were definitely falling one after another from a spot in the sky. At first in dribs and
drabs, then gradually more and more fell, until before they knew it they were caught in a
downpour. The objects pelting down from the sky were little black lumps about an inch
and a half long. In the lights of the parking lot it looked like slick black snow falling on
the men's shoulders, arms, and necks and sticking there. They desperately tried to yank
the objects off, but couldn't.
"Leeches!" someone yelled.
As if given a signal, the men all shouted and raced across the parking lot to the
restrooms. One of them, a young blond man, was knocked to the ground by a car he'd
run in front of. He jumped up, slammed his fist on the hood of the car, and loudly cursed
the driver. That was all, though, and he soon limped away toward the restrooms.
The leeches rained down hard for a time, then tapered off and stopped. Nakata
folded up his umbrella, brushed off the leeches, and went over to see how the injured
man was doing. A mound of the slimy creatures squirmed all around, so he couldn't get
very close, and the man on the ground was buried in them. Looking closely, Nakata
could see that he was bleeding from cut eyelids, and some of his teeth looked broken.
Nakata knew this was too much for him to handle by himself, so he hurried back to the
restaurant and told one of the employees that a man was lying in the parking lot, hurt.
"You'd better call the police, or else he might die," he said.
Not long after this Nakata found a truck driver willing to give him a ride as far as
Kobe. A sleepy-looking man in his mid-twenties, not very tall, with a ponytail, a pierced
ear, and a Chunichi Dragons baseball team cap, he sat there in the restaurant, smoking
and flipping through a comic book. A gaudy aloha shirt and oversize Nikes completed
his wardrobe. He tapped his cigarette ashes into the leftover broth in his bowl of ramen,
stared hard at Nakata, then gave a reluctant nod. "Yeah, okay. You can ride with me.
You kind of remind me of my grandpa. The way you look, or maybe how you talk, kind
of off the point.... At the end my grandpa got senile and died. A few years ago."
He went on to explain that they should get to Kobe by morning. He was
delivering furniture to a department store warehouse there. As he pulled his truck out of
the parking lot, they passed a car accident. A couple of patrol cars were already at the
scene, red lights flashing, and a policeman with a signal light was directing traffic. It
didn't appear to be much of an accident. A few cars had collided, the side of a minivan
was dented, a car's taillight broken.
The truck driver stuck his head out the window and exchanged a few words with
a patrolman, then rolled up his window. "He said a pile of leeches fell from the sky," he
said, unmoved. "They got crushed by cars, the road got all slippery, and some drivers
lost control. So go slow and take it easy, he told me. On top of that some local gang of
bikers beat up somebody. Leeches and bikers--what a weird combination. Keeps the
cops busy, at least."
He drove carefully toward the exit. Even going slow the truck slipped a couple of
times, and the driver straightened it out with a subtle twist of the wheel. "Man, it really
looks like a whole bunch fell down, and it's damn slippery. But, boy--leeches, that's
pretty gross. Ever had a leech stick to you?"
"No, as far as Nakata can remember, I don't think so," Nakata responded.
"I was brought up in the mountains of Gifu, and it happened to me lots of times.
I'd be walking in the woods and they'd fall down from the trees. Go wading in the
streams and they'd stick to your legs. I know a thing or two about leeches, believe me.
Once they get stuck on you they're hard to pull off. If you pull off a big sucker your skin
comes off and you'll have a scar. So the best thing is to burn 'em off. Awful things, the
way they suck your blood. And once they're filled up they get all soft and mushy. Pretty
gross, huh?"
"Yes, it certainly is," Nakata agreed.
"But leeches aren't supposed to fall down from the sky into some rest area
parking lot. I never heard of anything so stupid! The guys around here don't know the
first thing about leeches. Leeches don't fall from the sky, now do they?"
Nakata was silent and didn't respond.
"A few years back a huge number of millipedes appeared all at once in
Yamanashi Prefecture, and cars were slipping everywhere. Just like this, the road got all
slippery and there were a lot of accidents. They got all over the tracks and the trains
couldn't run either. But even millipedes aren't going to rain down from the sky. They
crawl out from somewhere. Anybody can see that."
"A long time ago I lived in Yamanashi. During the war."
"No kidding," the driver said. "Which war was that?"
Chapter 21
SCULPTOR KOICHI TAMURA STABBED TO DEATH
Found in Study, Floor a Sea of Blood
The world-renowned sculptor Koichi Tamura was found dead on the afternoon of the
30th in the study in his home in Nogata, Nakano Ward. The body was discovered by a
female housekeeper. Mr. Tamura was found facedown, nude, covered in blood. There
were signs of a struggle and the death is being treated as a homicide. The weapon used
was a knife from the kitchen discovered beside the body.
The police estimate the time of death as the evening of the 28th, and since Mr.
Tamura lived alone the body was only discovered two days later. Mr. Tamura suffered
several deep stab wounds to the chest from the sharp steak knife, and it is believed he
died almost instantly from massive loss of blood from injuries to the heart and lungs.
Several ribs were also broken from what appears to be massive blunt force. The police
have not announced having found any fingerprints or anything left behind at the scene.
It also appears that there were no witnesses to the crime.
Since the house was undisturbed, and valuables and a wallet near the scene were
not taken, police view the crime as a personal vendetta. Mr. Tamura's home is in a quiet
residential neighborhood, but no one heard anything at the time of the murder, and
neighbors were shocked at the news. Mr. Tamura had little to do with his neighbors and
lived quietly, and no one noticed anything out of the ordinary around the time of the
incident.
Mr. Tamura lived with his son (15), but according to the housekeeper the son
hasn't been seen in some ten days. The son has also been absent from his junior high and
police are tracing his whereabouts.
In addition to his residence, Mr. Tamura had an office and studio in Musashino
City, and according to his secretary, until the day before the murder he was working on
a new piece of sculpture as usual. On the day of the incident, there was a matter she had
to contact him about, but every time she phoned his residence she got his message
machine.
Mr. Tamura was born in Kokubunji, Tokyo. He entered the Dept. of Sculpture at
Tokyo Arts Institute, and while still a student completed many innovative pieces that
became the talk of the art world. His chief theme was the human subconscious, and his
sculptures, which were in a unique style that challenged the conventional, were
internationally acclaimed. His best known work was his major "Labyrinth" series, which
explored, through an uninhibited expression of the imagination, the beauty and
inspiration found in the meandering contours of labyrinths. He was at present a visiting
professor at an art institute, and two years ago, at the exhibition of his work at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York....
I stop reading at this point. There's a photo of our front gate, and one of my father
in younger days, and they give the newspaper an ominous feeling. I fold it twice and put
it on top of the table. Still sitting on the bed, I don't say anything, just press my
fingertips against my eyes. A dull sound, at a constant frequency, pounds in my ears. I
try shaking my head to get rid of it, but it won't go away.
I'm in my room in the library. It's seven p. m. Oshima and I have just shut the
place up for the night, and a while ago Miss Saeki drove off in her Volkswagen Golf. It's
just me and Oshima in the library now. And that irritating pounding in my ears.
"This paper's from two days ago. The article came out while you were up in the
mountains. When I saw it I thought maybe this Koichi Tamura might be your father. A
lot of the details fit. I should've shown it to you yesterday, but I wanted to wait until you
got settled in."
I nod, still pressing my eyes. Oshima doesn't say anything more.
"I didn't kill him, you know."
"I know that," Oshima says. "On the day of the murder you were here at the
library, reading until evening. You wouldn't have had enough time to go back to Tokyo,
murder your father, and then get back to Takamatsu. It's impossible."
But I wasn't so sure. I did the math and figured out he was murdered the same
night I woke up with my shirt covered in blood.
"But the paper does say the police are trying to locate you. As an important
witness."
I nod.
"If you go to the police and prove to them you have a firm alibi, it'd make things a
lot easier than trying to run around avoiding them. Of course I'll back you up."
"But if I do that, they'll take me back to Tokyo."
"I would think so. I mean, you still have to finish junior high--that's the law. You
can't just go anywhere you want to at your age. The law says you still need a guardian."
I shake my head. "I don't want to explain anything to anybody. And I don't want
to go back home to Tokyo, or back to school."
Quiet for a time, Oshima looks at me intently. "That's something you'll have to
decide for yourself," he finally says in a calm tone. "I think you have a right to live
however you want. Whether you're fifteen or fifty-one, what does it matter? But
unfortunately society doesn't agree. So let's say you don't explain anything to anybody.
You'll be constantly on the run from the police and society. Your life will be pretty
harsh. You're only fifteen, with your whole life ahead of you. You're okay with that?"
I don't say anything.
Oshima picks up the paper and scans the article again. "According to this you're
your father's only relative."
"I have a mother and an older sister," I explain, "but they left a long time ago, and
I don't know where they are. Even if I did, I seriously doubt they'd come to the funeral."
"Well, if you're not there, I wonder who's going to take care of everything. The
funeral, his business affairs."
"Like it said in the paper, he has a secretary at his office who's in charge of
everything. She knows about his business, so I'm sure she can handle it. I don't want
anything of his handed down to me. The house, his estate, whatever--they can get rid of
it however they want." The only thing he's handed down to me, I think, are my genes.
"Correct me if I'm wrong," Oshima says, "but you don't seem too sad your father
was murdered."
"No, I do feel sad. He's my father, after all. But what I really regret is that he
didn't die sooner. I know that's a terrible thing to say...."
Oshima shakes his head. "No problem. Now more than ever you have the right to
be honest."
"Well, I think..." My voice seems weak, lacking in authority. Unsure of where
they're headed, my words are sucked into the void. Oshima comes over and sits down
next to me.
"All kinds of things are happening to me," I begin. "Some I chose, some I didn't. I
don't know how to tell one from the other anymore. What I mean is, it feels like
everything's been decided in advance--that I'm following a path somebody else has
already mapped out for me. It doesn't matter how much I think things over, how much
effort I put into it. In fact, the harder I try, the more I lose my sense of who I am. It's like
my identity's an orbit that I've strayed far away from, and that really hurts. But more
than that, it scares me. Just thinking about it makes me flinch."
Oshima reaches out to touch my shoulder. I can feel the warmth of his hand. "For
the sake of argument, let's say all your choices and all your effort are destined to be a
waste. You're still very much yourself and nobody else. And you're forging ahead, as
yourself. So relax."
I raise my head and look at him. He sounds so convincing. "Why do you think
that?"
"Because there's irony involved."
"Irony?"
Oshima gazes deep into my eyes. "Listen, Kafka. What you're experiencing now
is the motif of many Greek tragedies. Man doesn't choose fate. Fate chooses man. That's
the basic worldview of Greek drama. And the sense of tragedy--according to Aristotle--
comes, ironically enough, not from the protagonist's weak points but from his good
qualities. Do you know what I'm getting at? People are drawn deeper into tragedy not by
their defects but by their virtues. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex being a great example.
Oedipus is drawn into tragedy not because of laziness or stupidity, but because of his
courage and honesty. So an inevitable irony results."
"But it's a hopeless situation."
"That depends," Oshima says. "Sometimes it is. But irony deepens a person, helps
them mature. It's the entrance to salvation on a higher plane, to a place where you can
find a more universal kind of hope. That's why people enjoy reading Greek tragedies
even now, why they're considered prototypical classics. I'm repeating myself, but
everything in life is metaphor. People don't usually kill their father and sleep with their
mother, right? In other words, we accept irony through a device called metaphor. And
through that we grow and become deeper human beings."
I don't say anything. I'm too involved in thinking about my own situation.
"How many people know you're in Takamatsu?" Oshima asks.
I shake my head. "Coming here was my own idea, so I don't think anybody else
knows."
"Then you'd better lay low in the library for a while. Don't go out to work at the
reception area. I don't think the police will be able to track you down, but if things get
sticky you can always hide out at the cabin."
I look at Oshima. "If I hadn't met you, I don't think I would've made it. There's
nobody else who can help me."
Oshima smiles. He takes his hand away from my shoulder and stares at his hand.
"That's not true. If you hadn't met me, I'm sure you would've found another path to take.
I don't know why, but I'm certain of it. I just get that feeling about you." He stands up
and brings over another newspaper from the desk. "By the way, this article was in the
paper the day before the other one. I remember it because it was so unusual. Maybe it's
just coincidence, but it took place near your house."
FISH RAIN FROM THE SKY!
2,000 Sardines and Mackerel in Nakano Ward Shopping District At around 6 p.m.
on the evening of the 29th, residents of the *-chome district of Nakano Ward were
startled when some 2,000 sardines and mackerel rained down from the sky. Two
housewives shopping in the neighborhood market received slight facial injuries when
struck by the falling fish, but no other injuries were reported. At the time of the incident
it was sunny, with no clouds or wind. Many of the fish were still alive and jumped about
on the pavement....
I finish reading the article and pass the paper back to Oshima. The reporter
speculated about several possible causes of the incident, though none of them are very
convincing. The police are investigating the possibility it involved theft and someone
playing a kind of practical joke. The Weather Service reported that there weren't any
atmospheric conditions present that might have led to fish raining from the sky. And
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries spokesman, still no comment.
"Do you have any idea why this happened?" Oshima asks me.
I shake my head. I don't have a clue.
"The day after your father was murdered, close to where it happened, two
thousand sardines and mackerel fall from the sky. Just coincidence?"
"I suppose so."
"The newspaper also says that at the Fujigawa rest area on the Tomei Highway,
late at night on the very same day, a mess of leeches fell from the sky in one small spot.
Several fender benders resulted, they say. Apparently the leeches were quite large. No
one can explain why leeches would rain from the sky. It was a clear night, not a cloud in
the sky. No idea why this happened, either?"
Again I shake my head.
Oshima folds up the newspaper and says, "Which leaves us with the fact that
strange, inexplicable events are happening one after the other. Maybe it's just a series of
coincidences, but it still bothers me. There's something about it I can't shake."
"Maybe it's a metaphor?" I venture.
"Maybe... But sardines and mackerel and leeches raining down from the sky?
What kind of metaphor is that?"
In the silence I try putting into words something I haven't been able to say for a
long time. "You know something? A few years back my father had a prophecy about
me."
"A prophecy?"
"I've never told anybody this before. I figured nobody'd believe me."
Oshima doesn't say a word. His silence, though, encourages me.
"More like a curse than a prophecy, I guess. My father told me this over and over.
Like he was chiseling each word into my brain." I take a deep breath and check once
more what it is I have to say. Not that I really need to check it--it's always there, banging
about in my head, whether I examine it or not. But I have to weigh the words one more
time. And this is what I say: "Someday you will murder your father and be with your
mother, he said."
Once I've spoken this, put this thought into concrete words, a hollow feeling
grabs hold of me. And inside that hollow, my heart pounds out a vacant, metallic rhythm.
Expression unchanged, Oshima gazes at me for a long time.
"So he said that someday you would kill your father with your own hands, that
you would sleep with your mother."
I nod a few more times.
"The same prophecy made about Oedipus. Though of course you knew that."
I nod. "But that's not all. There's an extra ingredient he threw into the mix. I have
a sister six years older than me, and my father said I would sleep with her, too."
"Your father actually said this to you?"
"Yeah. I was still in elementary school then, and didn't know what he meant by
'be with.' It was only a few years later that I caught on."
Oshima doesn't say anything.
"My father told me there was nothing I could do to escape this fate. That
prophecy is like a timing device buried inside my genes, and nothing can ever change it.
I will kill my father and be with my mother and sister."
Oshima stays silent for quite some time, like he's inspecting each word I'd spoken,
one by one, examining them for clues to what this is all about. "Why in the world would
your father tell you such an awful thing?" he finally asks.
"I have no idea. He didn't explain it beyond that," I say, shaking my head.
"Maybe he wanted revenge on his wife and daughter who left him. Wanted to punish
them, perhaps. Through me."
"Even if it meant hurting you?"
I nod. "To my father I'm probably nothing more than one of his sculptures.
Something he could make or break as he sees fit."
"That's a pretty twisted way of thinking," Oshima says.
"In our home everything was twisted. And when everything's twisted, what's
normal ends up looking weird too. I've known this for a long time, but I was a child.
Where else could I go?"
"I've seen your father's works a number of times," Oshima replies. "He's a
wonderful sculptor. His pieces are original, provocative, powerful. Uncompromising, is
how I'd put it. Most definitely the real thing."
"Maybe so. But the dregs left over from creating these he spread everywhere, like
a poison you can't escape. My father polluted everything he touched, damaged everyone
around him. I don't know if he did it because he wanted to. Maybe he had to. Maybe it's
just part of his makeup. Anyhow, I get the feeling he was connected to something very
unusual. Do you have any idea what I mean?"
"Yeah, I think so," Oshima says. "Something beyond good and evil. The source
of power, you might call it."
"And half my genes are made up of that. Maybe that's why my mother abandoned
me. Maybe she wanted to cut herself off from me because I was born from this terrible
source. Since I was polluted."
Oshima lightly presses his fingertips against his temples as he mulls this over. He
narrows his eyes and stares at me. "Is there any chance he's not your biological father?"
I shake my head. "A few years ago we got tested at a hospital. The two of us had
a DNA check done on our blood. No doubt about it--biologically we're father and son a
hundred percent. They showed me the results of the tests."
"Very cautious of him."
"I guess he wanted me to know I was one of the works he'd created. Something
he'd finished and signed."
Oshima's fingers stay pressed to his temples. "But your father's prophecy didn't
come true, did it? You didn't murder him. You were here in Takamatsu when it
happened. Somebody else killed him in Tokyo."
Silently I spread my hands out in front of me and stare at them. Those hands that,
in the darkness of night, had been covered with blood. "I'm not so sure of that," I tell
him.
And I proceed to tell him everything. About how that night, on my way back to
the hotel, I'd lost consciousness for a few hours. About waking up in the woods behind
the shrine, my shirt sticky with somebody's blood. About washing the blood off in the
restroom. About how several hours had been erased from my memory. To save time I
don't go into how I stayed overnight at Sakura's. Oshima asks the occasional question,
and files away the details in his head. But he doesn't voice any opinions.
"I have no idea how that blood got all over me, or whose blood it could be. It's a
complete blank," I tell him. "But maybe I did kill my father with my own hands, not
metaphorically. I really get the feeling that I did. Like you said, I was in Takamatsu that
day--I definitely didn't go to Tokyo. But In dreams begin responsibilities, right?"
Oshima nods. "Yeats."
"So maybe I murdered him through a dream," I say. "Maybe I went through some
special dream circuit or something and killed him."
"To you that might feel like the truth, but nobody's going to grill you about your
poetic responsibilities. Certainly not the police. Nobody can be in two places at once. It's
a scientific fact--Einstein and all that--and the law accepts that principle."
"But I'm not talking about science or law here."
"What you're talking about, Kafka," Oshima says, "is just a theory. A bold,
surrealistic theory, to be sure, but one that belongs in a science fiction novel."
"Of course it's just a theory. I know that. I don't think anybody else is going to
believe such a stupid thing. But my father always used to say that without
counterevidence to refute a theory, science would never progress. A theory is a
battlefield in your head--that was his pet phrase. And right now I can't think of any
evidence to counter my hypothesis."
Oshima is silent. And I can't think of anything else to say.
"Anyway," Oshima finally says, "that's why you ran away to Shikoku. To escape
your father's curse."
I nod, and point to the folded-up newspaper. "But it looks like there's no escape."
Distance won't solve anything, the boy named Crow says.
"Well, you definitely need a hiding place," Oshima says. "Beyond that there's not
much I can say."
I suddenly realize how exhausted I am. I lean against Oshima, and he wraps his
arms around me.
I push my face up against his flat chest. "Oshima, I don't want to do those things.
I don't want to kill my father. Or be with my mother and sister."
"Of course you don't," he replies, running his fingers through my short hair.
"How could you?"
"Not even in dreams."
"Or in a metaphor," Oshima adds. "Or in an allegory, or an analogy." He pauses
and then says, "If you don't mind, I'll stay with you here tonight. I can sleep on the
chair."
But I turn him down. I think I'm better off alone for a while, I tell him.
Oshima brushes the strands of hair off his forehead. After hesitating a bit he says,
"I know I'm a hopeless, damaged, homosexual woman, and if that's what's bothering
you..."
"No," I say, "that's not it at all. I just need some time alone to think. Too many
things have happened all at once. That's all."
Oshima writes down a phone number on a memo pad. "In the middle of the night,
if you feel like talking to anybody, call this number. Don't hesitate, okay? I'm a light
sleeper anyway." I thank him.
That's the night I see a ghost.
Chapter 22
The truck Nakata was riding in arrived in Kobe just after five in the morning. It was
light out, but the warehouse was still closed and their freight couldn't be unloaded. They
parked the truck in a broad street near the harbor and took a nap. The young driver
stretched out on the back seat--his usual spot for napping--and was soon snoring away
contentedly. His snores sometimes woke Nakata up, but each time he quickly dropped
back into a comfortable sleep. Insomnia was one phenomenon Nakata had never
experienced.
A little before eight the young driver sat up and gave a big yawn. "Hey, Gramps,
ya hungry?" he asked. He was busy shaving with an electric razor, using the rearview
mirror.
"Now that you mention it, yes, Nakata does feel a little hungry."
"Well, let's go grab some breakfast."
From the time they left Fujigawa to their arrival in Kobe, Nakata had spent most
of the time sleeping. The young driver barely said a word the whole time, just drove on,
listening to a late-night radio show. Occasionally he'd sing along to a song, none of
which Nakata had ever heard before. He wondered if they were even in Japanese, since
he could barely understand any of the lyrics, just the occasional word. From his bag he
took out the chocolate and rice balls he'd gotten from the two young office girls in
Shinjuku, and shared them.
The driver had chain-smoked, saying it helped keep him awake, so Nakata's
clothes were reeking of smoke by the time they arrived in Kobe.
Bag and umbrella in hand, Nakata clambered down from the truck.
"You better leave that stuff in the truck," the driver said. "We're not going far, and
we'll come right back after we eat."
"Yes, you're quite right, but Nakata feels better having them."
The young man frowned. "Whatever. It's not like I'm lugging them around. It's up
to you."
"Much obliged."
"My name's Hoshino, by the way. Spelled the same as the former manager of the
Chunichi Dragons. We're not related, though."
"Mr. Hoshino, is it? Very glad to meet you. My name is Nakata."
"Come on--I knew that already," Hoshino said.
He knew the neighborhood and strode off down the street, Nakata almost having
to trot to keep up. They wound up in a small diner down a back street, seated among
other truck drivers and stevedores from the docks. Not a single necktie in sight. All of
them were intently shoveling in their breakfasts like they were filling up a gas tank. The
place was filled with the clatter of dishes, the waitress yelling out orders, the morning
NHK news on the TV buzzing in the corner.
Hoshino pointed to the menu taped to the wall. "Just order whatever you want,
Gramps. The food's cheap here, and pretty good."
"All right," Nakata said, and did as he was told, staring at the menu until he
remembered he couldn't read. "I'm sorry, Mr. Hoshino, but I'm not very bright and can't
read."
"Is that right?" Hoshino said, amazed. "Can't read? That's pretty rare these days.
But that's okay. I'm having the grilled fish and omelette--why don't you get the same?"
"That sounds good. Grilled fish and omelettes are some of Nakata's favorites."
"Glad to hear it."
"I enjoy eel a lot, too."
"Yeah? I like eel myself. But eel's not something you have in the morning, is it."
"That's right. And Nakata had eel last night, when Mr. Hagita bought some for
me."
"Glad to hear it," Hoshino said again. "Two orders of the grilled fish set plus
omelettes!" he yelled out to the waitress. "And super-size one of the rices, okay?"
"Two grilled fish sets, plus omelettes! One rice super-size!" the waitress called
loudly to the cooks.
"Isn't it kind of a pain, not being able to read?" Hoshino asked.
"Yes, sometimes I have trouble because I can't read. As long as I stay in Nakano
Ward in Tokyo it's not so bad, but if I go somewhere else, like now, it's very hard for
me."
"I guess so. Kobe's pretty far from Nakano."
"Nakata doesn't know north and south. All I know is left and right. So I get lost,
and can't buy tickets, either."
"Incredible you were able to get this far."
"Many people were kind enough to help me. You're one of them, Mr. Hoshino. I
don't know how to thank you."
"That must be tough, though, not being able to read. My grandad was pretty
senile, but he could still read well enough."
"I'm especially dumb."
"Is everybody in your family like that?"
"No, they aren't. My older brother is a depart mint head at a place called Itohchew,
and my younger brother works at an office called Em-i-tee-i."
"Wow," Hoshino said. "Pretty elite bunch. So you're the only one who's a bit off,
huh?"
"Yes, Nakata's the only one who had an accident and isn't bright. That's why I'm
always being told not to go out too much and cause any trouble for my brothers, nieces,
and nephews."
"Yeah, I guess most people would find it kind of awkward to have someone like
you show up."
"I don't understand difficult things, but I know that as long as I stay in Nakano
Ward I don't get lost. The Governor helped me out, and I got along well with cats. Once
a month I got my hair cut and every once in a while I'd eat eel. But after Johnnie Walker,
Nakata couldn't stay in Nakano anymore."
"Johnnie Walker?"
"That's right. He has boots and a tall black hat, and a vest and walking stick. He
collects cats to get their souls."
"You don't say...," Hoshino said. "I don't have much patience with long stories.
So anyway, something happened and you left Nakano, right?"
"That's right. I left Nakano."
"So where are you headed?"
"Nakata doesn't know yet. But after we got here I knew I had to go across a
bridge. A big bridge near here."
"Ah, so you're going to Shikoku."
"I'm very sorry, Mr. Hoshino, but I don't know geography very well. If you go
over the bridge are you in Shikoku?"
"Yeah. If you're talking about a big bridge around here, that's the one to Shikoku.
There're three of them, actually. One goes from Kobe to Awaji Island, then on to
Tokushima. Another goes from below Kurashiki over to Sakaide. And one connects
Onomichi and Imabari. One bridge would've been plenty, but politicians stuck their
noses into it and they wound up with three. Typical pork-barrel projects." Hoshino
poured out some water onto the resin tabletop and drew an abbreviated map of Japan
with his finger, indicating the three bridges connecting Honshu and Shikoku.
"Are these bridges really big?" Nakata asked.
"They're huge."
"Is that right? Anyway, Nakata's going to cross over one of them. Probably
whichever one is closest. I'll figure out what to do after that later on."
"So what you're saying is you don't have any friends or anybody where you're
headed?"
"No, Nakata doesn't know anybody there."
"You're just going to cross the bridge to Shikoku and then go somewhere else."
"That's right."
"And you don't know where that somewhere is."
"I have no idea. But I think I'll know it when I get there."
"Jeez," Hoshino said. He brushed back his hair, gave his ponytail a tug, and put
on his Chunichi Dragons cap.
Their food was served, and they started eating.
"Pretty good omelette, huh?" Hoshino asked.
"Yes, it's very good. It tastes different from the omelettes I always eat in
Nakano."
"That's 'cause it's Kansai style. Not at all like those tasteless flat things that pass
as omelettes in Tokyo."
The two of them then silently enjoyed their meal, the omelettes, salt-grilled
mackerel, miso soup with shellfish, pickled turnips, seasoned spinach, seaweed. They
didn't leave a grain of rice. Nakata made sure to chew each bite thirty-two times, so it
took quite a while for him to finish.
"Get enough, Mr. Nakata?"
"Yes, plenty. How about you, Mr. Hoshino?"
"Even me, I'm stuffed. Perks up the old spirits, doesn't it, to have such a great
breakfast?"
"Yes, it certainly does."
"How 'bout it? Gotta take a dump?"
"Now that you mention it, I do feel like it."
"Go right ahead. Toilet's over there."
"What about you, Mr. Hoshino?"
"I'll go later on. Take my time about it."
"Thank you. Nakata will go take a dump, then."
"Hey, not so loud. People are still eating here."
"I'm sorry. Nakata's not very bright."
"Never mind. Just go."
"Do you mind if I brush my teeth, too?"
"No, go ahead. We got time. Do whatever you want. Tell you what, I don't think
you'll be needing that umbrella. You're just going to the toilet, right?"
"All right. I'll leave the umbrella."
When Nakata came back from the toilet Hoshino had already paid their bill.
"Mr. Hoshino, I have money with me, so please let me at least pay for breakfast."
Hoshino shook his head. "It's okay. I owe my grandpa big time. Back then I was
kind of wild."
"I see. But I'm not your grandfather."
"That's my problem, so don't worry about it. No arguments, okay? Just let me
treat you."
After a moment's thought Nakata decided to accept the young man's generosity.
"Thank you so much then. It was a wonderful meal."
"Hey, it's just some mackerel and omelettes at a nothing little diner. No need to
bow like that."
"But you know, Mr. Hoshino, ever since Nakata left Nakano Ward everyone's
been so nice to me I haven't had to use hardly any money at all."
"Sweet," Hoshino said, impressed.
Nakata had a waitress fill his little thermos with hot tea, then he carefully
replaced it in his bag. Walking back to where the truck was parked, Hoshino said, "So,
about this going to Shikoku thing..."
"Yes?" Nakata replied.
"Why do you want to go there?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know why you're going, or even where you're going. But you've still
got to go to Shikoku?"
"That's right. Nakata's going to cross a big bridge."
"Things'll be clearer once you're on the other side?"
"I think so. I won't know anything until I cross the bridge."
"Hmm," Hoshino said. "So crossing that bridge is very important."
"Yes, that's more important than anything."
"Man alive," Hoshino said, scratching his head.
The young man had to drive his truck over to the warehouse to deliver his load of
furniture, so he told Nakata to wait for him at a small park near the harbor.
"Don't move from here, okay?" Hoshino cautioned him. "There's a restroom over
there, and a water fountain. You got everything you need. If you wander off somewhere,
you might not find your way back."
"I understand. I'm not in Nakano Ward anymore."
"Exactly. This isn't Nakano. So sit tight, and I'll be back real soon."
"All right. I'll stay right here."
"Good. I'll be back as soon as I finish my delivery."
Nakata did as he was told, not moving from the bench, not even to use the
restroom. He didn't find staying put in one place for a long time very hard. Sitting still,
in fact, was his specialty.
He could see the sea from where he sat. This he hadn't seen for a long, long time.
When he was little, he and his family had gone to the seaside any number of times. He'd
put on trunks, splash around on the shore, gather seashells at low tide. But these
memories weren't clear. It was like this had taken place in another world. Since then, he
couldn't recall seeing the sea even once.
After the strange incident in the hills of Yamanashi, Nakata went back to school
in Tokyo. He'd regained consciousness and physically was fine, but his memory had
been wiped clean, and he never regained the ability to read and write. He couldn't read
his school textbooks, and couldn't take any tests. All the knowledge he'd gained up till
then had vanished, as had the ability, to a great extent, to think in abstract terms. Still,
they let him graduate. He couldn't follow what was being taught, and instead sat quietly
in a corner of the classroom. When the teacher told him to do something, he followed
her instructions to the letter. He didn't bother anyone, so teachers tended to forget he
was even there. He was more like a guest sitting in than a burden.
People soon forgot that until the accident he'd always gotten straight As. But now
the school activities and events took place without him. He didn't make any friends.
None of this bothered him, though. Being left alone meant he could be lost in his own
little world. What absorbed him the most at school was taking care of the rabbits and
goats they raised there, tending the flower beds outside and cleaning the classrooms. A
constant smile on his face, he never tired of these chores.
He was essentially forgotten about at home, too. Once they learned that their
eldest son couldn't read anymore or follow along with his lessons, Nakata's parents--
totally focused on their children's education--ignored him and turned their attention to
his younger brothers. It was impossible for Nakata to go on to public junior high, so
once he graduated from elementary school he was sent to live with relatives in Nagano
Prefecture, in his mother's hometown. There he attended agriculture school. Since he
still couldn't read he had a hard time with his schoolwork, but he loved working in the
fields. He might even have become a farmer, if his classmates hadn't tormented him so
much. They enjoyed beating up this outsider, this city kid, so much. His injuries became
so severe (one cauliflower ear included) that his grandparents pulled him out of school
and kept him at home to help out around the house. Nakata was a quiet, obedient child,
and his grandparents loved him very much.
It was about this time that he discovered he could speak with cats. His
grandparents had a few cats around the house, and Nakata became good friends with
them. At first he was able to speak only a few words, but he knuckled down like he was
trying to master a foreign language and before long was able to carry on extended
conversations. Whenever he was free he liked to sit on the porch and talk with the cats.
For their part, the cats taught him a lot about nature and the world around him. Actually
almost all the basic knowledge he had about the world and how it worked he learned
from his feline friends.
At fifteen he was sent to a nearby furniture company to learn woodworking. It
was less a factory than a small woodworking shop making folkcraft-type furniture.
Chairs, tables, and chests made there were shipped to Tokyo. Nakata grew to love
woodworking. His boss took a great liking to him, for he was skilled with his hands,
never skipped any small details, didn't talk much, and never, ever complained. Reading
a blueprint and adding figures weren't his forte, but aside from these tasks he did well at
everything he set his hand to. Once he got the manufacturing steps in his mind he could
repeat them endlessly, tirelessly. After a two-year apprenticeship he was given full-time
employment.
Nakata worked there until he was past fifty, never once having an accident or
calling in sick. He didn't drink or smoke, didn't stay up late or overeat. He never
watched TV, and listened to the radio only for the morning exercise program. Day after
day he just made furniture. His grandparents eventually passed away, as did his parents.
Everybody liked him, though he didn't make any close friends. Perhaps that was only to
be expected. When most people tried talking to Nakata, ten minutes was all it took for
them to run out of things to say.
Still, he never felt lonely or unhappy. He never felt sexual desire, or even wanted
to be with anyone. He understood he was different from other people. Though no one
else noticed this, he thought his shadow on the ground was paler, lighter, than that of
other people. The only ones who really understood him were the cats. On days off he'd
sit on a park bench and spend the whole day chatting with them. Strangely enough, with
cats he never ran out of things to talk about.
The owner of the furniture company passed away when Nakata was fifty-two, and
the woodworking shop was closed soon afterward. That kind of gloomy, dark,
traditional furniture didn't sell as well as it used to. The craftsmen were all getting on in
years, and no young people were interested in learning the trade. The shop itself,
originally in the middle of a field, was now surrounded by newly built homes, and
complaints started to come in about both the noise and the smoke when they burned
wood shavings. The owner's son, who worked in town for an accounting firm, had no
interest in taking over the business, so as soon as his father passed away he sold the
property to a real estate developer. For his part, the developer tore down the shop, had
the land graded, and sold it to an apartment complex developer, who constructed a sixstory
condominium on the property. Every single apartment in the condo sold out on the
first day they were put on sale.
That's how Nakata lost his job. The company had some outstanding loans to pay
off, so he received only a pittance as retirement pay. Afterward he couldn't find another
job. Who was going to hire an illiterate man in his fifties whose only skill was crafting
antique furniture nobody wanted anymore?
Nakata had worked steadily for thirty-seven years at the plant without taking a
single day of leave, so he did have a fair amount of money in his savings account at the
local post office. He generally spent very little on himself, so even without finding
another job he should have been able to have a comfortable old age on his savings.
Since he couldn't read or write, a cousin of his who worked at city hall managed his
account for him. Though kind enough, this cousin wasn't so quick on the uptake and was
tricked into investing in a condominium at a ski resort by an unscrupulous real estate
broker and ended up deeply in debt. Around the same time that Nakata lost his job, this
cousin disappeared with his entire family to escape his creditors. Some yakuza-type loan
sharks were after him, apparently. Nobody knew where this family was, or even if they
were still alive.
When Nakata had an acquaintance go with him to the post office to check on the
balance in his account, he found out that only a few hundred dollars were left. His
retirement pay, which had been deposited directly into the account, had also vanished.
One could only say that Nakata was extremely unlucky--losing his job and finding
himself penniless. His relatives were sympathetic, but they'd been asked to put up
collateral and likewise lost everything they'd invested with the cousin. So none of them
had the resources to help Nakata in his time of need.
In the end the older of Nakata's two younger brothers in Tokyo decided to look
after him for the time being. He owned a small apartment building in Nakano that
catered to single men--this was part of his inheritance from his parents--and he offered
one of the units to his older brother. He also looked after the money his parents had
willed to Nakata--not a great amount--and arranged for him to receive a subsidy for the
mentally challenged from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. That was the extent of
the brother's "care." Despite his illiteracy, Nakata was able to take care of his daily
needs by himself, and as long as his rent was covered he was able to manage.
His two brothers had very little contact with him. They saw him a few times when
he first moved back to Tokyo, but that was it. They had lived apart for over thirty years,
and their lifestyles were too different. Neither brother had any particular feelings toward
him, and in any case they were too busy with their own careers to take care of a retarded
sibling.
But this cold treatment by his relatives didn't faze Nakata. He was used to being
alone and actually tensed up if people went out of their way to be nice to him. He wasn't
angry, either, that his cousin had squandered his life savings. Naturally he understood it
was too bad it happened, but he wasn't disappointed by the whole affair. Nakata had no
idea what a resort condo was, or what "investing" meant, nor did he understand what
taking out a "loan" involved. He lived in a world circumscribed by a very limited
vocabulary.
Only amounts up to fifty dollars or so had any meaning to him. Anything above
that--a thousand dollars, ten thousand, a hundred thousand--was all the same to him. A
lot of money, that's all it meant. He might have savings, but he'd never seen it. They just
told him, "This is how much you have in your account," and told him an amount, which
to him was an abstract concept. So when it all vanished he never had the sense that he'd
actually lost something real.
So Nakata lived a contented life in the small apartment his brother provided,
receiving his monthly subsidy, using his special bus pass, going to the local park to chat
with the cats. This little corner of Nakano became his new world. Just like dogs and cats,
he marked off his territory, a boundary line beyond which, except in unusual
circumstances, he never ventured. As long as he stayed there he felt safe and content. No
dissatisfactions, no anger at anything. No feelings of loneliness, anxieties about the
future, or worries that his life was difficult or inconvenient. Day after day, for more than
ten years, this was his life, leisurely enjoying whatever came along.
Until the day that Johnnie Walker showed up.
Nakata hadn't seen the sea in years, for there was no sea in Nagano Prefecture, or
in Nakano Ward. Now for the first time, he realized that he'd lost the sea for so long. He
hadn't even thought about it all those many years. He nodded several times to himself,
confirming this fact. He took off his hat, rubbed his closely-cropped head with his palm,
put his hat back on, and gazed out at the sea. This is the extent of his knowledge of the
sea: it was very big, it was salty, and fish lived there.
He sat there on the bench, breathing in the scent of the sea, watching seagulls
circle overhead, gazing at ships anchored far offshore. He didn't tire of the view. An
occasional white seagull would alight on the fresh summer grass in the park. The white
against the green was beautiful. Nakata tried calling out to the seagull as it walked over
the grass, but it didn't reply and just stared at him coolly. There were no cats around.
The only animals in the park were seagulls and sparrows. As he sipped hot tea from his
thermos, rain began pelting down, and Nakata opened up his precious umbrella.
By the time Hoshino came back to the park, just before twelve, it had stopped
raining. Nakata was seated on the bench just as he'd left him, umbrella folded, staring
out at the sea. Hoshino had parked his truck somewhere and arrived in a taxi.
"Hey, I'm sorry it took so long," he apologized. A vinyl Boston bag hung from his
shoulder. "I thought I'd be finished sooner but all kinds of things came up. It's like every
department store has one guy who's got to be a pain in the butt."
"Nakata didn't mind at all. I was just sitting here, looking at the sea."
"Hmm," Hoshino murmured. He looked out in the same direction, but all he saw
was a shabby old pier and oil floating on the surface of the water.
"I haven't seen the sea in a long time."
"That right?"
"The last time I saw it was in elementary school. I went to the seaside at
Enoshima."
"I bet that was a long time ago."
"Japan was occupied by the Americans back then. The seashore at Enoshima was
filled with American soldiers."
"You gotta be kidding."
"No, I'm not kidding."
"Come on," Hoshino said. "Japan was never occupied by America."
"Nakata doesn't know the details, but America had planes called B-29s. They
dropped a lot of bombs on Tokyo, so I went to Yamanashi Prefecture. That's where I got
sick."
"Yeah? Whatever... I told you I don't like long stories. Anyway, let's head on out.
It took longer than I thought, and it's gonna be dark soon if we don't get a move on."
"Where are we going?"
"Shikoku, of course. We'll cross the bridge. You said you're going to Shikoku,
didn't you?"
"I did. But what about your job?"
"Don't worry about it. It'll still be there when I get back. I've been putting in some
long hours and was thinking I should take a few days off. To tell the truth, I've never
been to Shikoku either. Might as well check it out. Plus you can't read, right? So it'll be a
whole lot easier if I'm with you to help buy the tickets. Unless you don't want me
along."
"No, Nakata would be happy to have you along."
"Then let's do it. I already checked out the bus schedule. Shikoku--here we
come!"
Chapter 23
I don't know if ghost is the right word, but it definitely isn't something of this world--
that much I can tell at a glance.
I sense something and suddenly wake up and there she is. It's the middle of the
night but the room is strangely light, moonlight streaming through the window. I know I
closed the curtains before going to bed, but now they're wide open. The girl's silhouette
is clearly outlined, bathed by the bone white light of the moon.
She's about my age, fifteen or sixteen. I'm guessing fifteen. There's a big
difference between fifteen and sixteen. She's small and slim, holds herself erect, and
doesn't seem delicate at all. Her hair hangs down to her shoulders, with bangs on her
forehead. She's wearing a blue dress with a billowing hem that's just the right length.
She doesn't have any shoes or socks on. The buttons on the cuffs of her dress are neatly
done up. Her dress has a rounded, open collar, showing off her well-formed neck.
She's sitting at the desk, chin resting in her hands, staring at the wall and thinking
about something. Nothing too complex, I'd say. It looks more like she's lost in some
pleasant, warm memory of not so long ago. Every once in a while a hint of a smile
gathers at the corners of her mouth. But the shadows cast by the moonlight keep me
from making out any details of her expression. I don't want to interrupt whatever it is
she's doing, so I pretend to be asleep, holding my breath and trying not to be noticed.
She's got to be a ghost. First of all, she's just too beautiful. Her features are
gorgeous, but it's not only that. She's so perfect I know she can't be real. She's like a
person who stepped right out of a dream. The purity of her beauty gives me a feeling
close to sadness--a very natural feeling, though one that only something extraordinary
could produce.
I'm wrapped in my covers, holding my breath. She continues to sit there at the
desk, chin propped in her hands, barely stirring. Occasionally her chin shifts a fraction,
changing the angle of her head ever so slightly. As far as anything moving in the room,
that's it. I can see the large flowering dogwood just outside the window, glistening
silently in the moonlight. There's no wind, and I can't hear a sound. The whole thing
feels like I might've died, unknowingly. I'm dead, and this girl and I have sunk to the
bottom of a deep crater lake.
All of a sudden she pulls her hands away from her chin and places them on her
lap. Two small pale knees show at her hemline. She stops gazing at the wall and turns in
my direction. She reaches up and touches the hair at her forehead--her slim, girlish
fingers rest for a time on her forehead, as if she's trying to draw out some forgotten
thought. She's looking at me. My heart beats dully in my chest, but strangely enough I
don't feel like I'm being looked at. Maybe she's not looking at me but beyond me.
In the depths of our crater lake, everything is silent. The volcano's been extinct
for ages. Layer upon layer of solitude, like folds of soft mud. The little bit of light that
manages to penetrate to the depths lights up the surroundings like the remains of some
faint, distant memory. At these depths there's no sign of life. I don't know how long she
looks at me--not at me, maybe, but at the spot where I am. Time's rules don't apply here.
Time expands, then contracts, all in tune with the stirrings of the heart.
And then, without warning, the girl stands up and heads toward the door on her
slender legs. The door is shut, yet soundlessly she disappears.
I stay where I am, in bed. My eyes open just a slit, and I don't move a muscle. For
all I know she might come back, I think. I want her to, I realize. But no matter how long
I wait she doesn't return. I raise my head and glance at the fluorescent numbers on the
alarm clock next to my bed .3:25. I get out of bed, walk over to the chair she was sitting
on, and touch it. It's not warm at all. I check out the desktop, in hopes of finding
something--a single hair, perhaps?--she left behind. But there's nothing. I sit down on
the chair, massaging my cheeks with the palms of my hands, and breathe a deep sigh.
I close the curtains and crawl back under the covers, but there's no way I can go
back to sleep now. My head's too full of that enigmatic girl. A strange, terrific force
unlike anything I've ever experienced is sprouting in my heart, taking root there,
growing. Shut up behind my rib cage, my warm heart expands and contracts
independent of my will--over and over.
I switch on the light and wait for the dawn, sitting up in bed. I can't read, can't
listen to music. I can't do anything but just sit there, waiting for morning to come. As the
sky begins to lighten I finally sleep a bit. When I wake up, my pillow's cold and damp
with tears. But tears for what? I have no idea.
Around nine Oshima roars up in his Miata, and we get the library ready to open.
After we get everything done I make him some coffee. He taught me how to do it just
right. You grind the beans by hand, boil up some water in a narrow spouted pot, let it sit
for a while, then slowly--and I mean slowly--pour the water through a paper filter. When
the coffee's ready Oshima puts in the smallest dab of sugar, just for show, basically, but
no cream--the best way, he insists. I make myself some Earl Grey tea.
Oshima has on a shiny brown short-sleeved shirt and white linen trousers. Wiping
his glasses with a brand-new handkerchief he pulls from his pocket, he turns to me.
"You don't look like you got much sleep."
"There's something I'd like you to do for me," I say.
"Name it."
"I want to listen to 'Kafka on the Shore.' Can you get hold of the record?"
"Not the CD?"
"If possible I'd like to listen to the record, to hear how it originally sounded. Of
course we'd have to find a record player, too."
Oshima rests his fingers on his temple and thinks. "There might be an old stereo
in the storeroom. Can't guarantee it still works, though."
We go into a small room facing the parking lot. There are no windows, only a
skylight high up. A mess of objects from various periods are strewn around--furniture,
dishes, magazines, clothes, and paintings. Some of them are obviously valuable, but
some, most, in fact, don't look like they're worth much.
"Someday we've got to get rid of all this junk," Oshima remarks, "but nobody's
been brave enough to take the plunge."
In the middle of the room, where time seems to have drifted to a halt, we find an
old Sansui stereo. Covered in a thin layer of white dust, the stereo itself looks in good
shape, though it must be over twenty-five years since this was up-to-date audio
equipment. The whole set consists of a receiver, amp, turntable, and bookshelf speakers.
We also find a collection of old LPs, mostly sixties pop music--Beatles, Stones, Beach
Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, Stevie Wonder. About thirty albums, all told. I take some
out of their jackets. Whoever listened to these took good care of them, because there's
no trace of mold and not a scratch anywhere.
There's a guitar in the storeroom as well, still with strings. Plus a pile of old
magazines I've never heard of, and an old-fashioned tennis racket. All like the ruins of
some not-so-distant past.
"I imagine all this stuff belonged to Miss Saeki's boyfriend," Oshima says. "Like I
mentioned, he used to live in this building, and they must've thrown his things down
here. The stereo, though, looks more recent than that."
We lug the stereo and records to my room. We dust it off, plug it in, connect up
the player and amp, and hit the switch. The little green light on the amp comes on and
the turntable begins to revolve. I check the cartridge and find it still has a decent needle,
then take out the red vinyl record of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and put it
on the turntable. The familiar guitar intro starts to play. The sound's much cleaner than I
expected.
"Japan has its share of problems," Oshima says, smiling, "but we sure know how
to make a sound system. This thing hasn't been used in ages, but it still sounds great."
We listen to the Beatles album for a while. Compared to the CD version, it
sounds like different music altogether.
"Well, we've got something to listen to it on," Oshima concludes, "but getting
hold of a single of 'Kafka on the Shore' might be a problem. That's a pretty rare item
nowadays. I tell you what--I'll ask my mother. She's probably got a copy tucked away
somewhere. Or at least she'll know somebody who does."
I nod.
Oshima raises a finger, like a teacher warning a pupil. "One thing, though. Make
sure you never play it when Miss Saeki's here. No matter what. Understood?"
I nod again.
"Like in Casablanca," he says, and hums the opening bars of "As Time Goes By."
"Just don't play that one song, okay?"
"Oshima, there's something I want to ask. Does any fifteen-year-old girl come
here?"
"By here you mean the library?"
I nod.
Oshima tilts his head and gives it some thought. "Not as far as I know," he says,
staring at me like he's looking into the room from a window. "That's a strange thing to
ask."
"I think I saw her recently," I say.
"When was this?"
"Last night."
"You saw a fifteen-year-old girl here last night?"
"Yeah."
"What kind of girl?"
I blush a bit. "Just a girl. Hair down to her shoulders. Wearing a blue dress."
"Was she pretty?"
I nod.
"Could be a sexual fantasy," Oshima says, and grins. "The world's full of weird
things. But for a healthy, heterosexual kid your age, having fantasies like that's not so
strange."
I remember how Oshima saw me buck naked up at the cabin, and blush even
more.
During our lunch break Oshima quietly hands me a single of "Kafka on the
Shore" in a square little jacket. "Turns out my mom did have one. Five copies, if you
can believe it. She really takes good care of things. A bit of a pack rat, but I guess we
shouldn't complain."
"Thanks," I say.
I go back to my room and take the record out of the jacket. The record looks like
it's never been played. In the record jacket's photo, Miss Saeki--she was nineteen,
according to Oshima--is sitting at a piano in a recording studio. Looking straight at the
camera, she's resting her chin in her hands on the music stand, her head tilted slightly to
one side, a shy, unaffected smile on her face, closed lips spread pleasantly wide, with
charming lines at the corners. It doesn't look like she's wearing any makeup. Her hair's
held back by a plastic clip so it won't fall into her face, and part of her right ear's visible
through the strands. Her light blue dress is short and loose-fitting, and she has a silver
bracelet on her left wrist, her only accessory. A pair of slender sandals lie next to her
piano stool, and her bare feet are lovely.
She looks like a symbol of something. A certain time, a certain place. A certain
state of mind. She's like a spirit that's sprung up from a happy chance encounter. An
eternal, naive innocence, never to be marred, floats around her like spores in spring.
Time had come to a standstill in this photograph .1969--a scene from long before I was
even born.
I knew from the first that the young girl who visited my room last night was Miss
Saeki. I never doubted it for a second, but just had to make sure.
Compared to when she was fifteen, Miss Saeki at nineteen looks more grown-up,
more mature. If I had to compare the two, I'd say the outline of her face looks sharper,
more defined, in the photo. A certain anxiousness is missing from the older of the two.
But otherwise this nineteen-year-old and the fifteen-year-old I saw are nearly identical.
The smile in the photo's the same one I saw last night. How she held her chin in her
hands, and tilted her head--also the same. And in Miss Saeki now, the real-time Miss
Saeki, I can see the same expressions and gestures. I'm delighted that those features, and
her sense of the otherworldly, haven't changed a bit. Even her build is almost the same.
Still, there's something in this photo of the nineteen-year-old that the middle-aged
woman I know has lost forever. You might call it an outpouring of energy. Nothing
showy, it's colorless, transparent, like fresh water secretly seeping out between rocks--a
kind of natural, unspoiled appeal that shoots straight to your heart. That brilliant energy
seeps out of her entire being as she sits there at the piano. Just by looking at that happy
smile, you can trace the beautiful path that a contented heart must follow. Like a firefly's
glow that persists long after it's disappeared into the darkness.
I sit on my bed for a long time, record jacket in hand, not thinking about anything,
just letting time pass by. I open my eyes, go to the window, and take a deep breath of
fresh air, catching a whiff of the sea on the breeze that's come up through a pine forest.
What I saw here in this room the night before was definitely Miss Saeki at age fifteen.
The real Miss Saeki, of course, is still alive. A fifty-something woman, living a real life
in the real world. Even now she's in her room upstairs at her desk, working away. To see
her, all I need to do is go out of this room and up the stairs, and there she'll be. I can
meet her, talk with her--but none of that changes the fact that what I saw here was her
ghost. Oshima told me people can't be in two places at once, but I think it's possible. In
fact, I'm sure of it. While they're still alive, people can become ghosts.
And there's another important fact: I'm drawn to that ghost, attracted to her. Not
to the Miss Saeki who's here right now, but to the fifteen-year-old who isn't. Very
attracted, a feeling so strong I can't explain it. And no matter what anybody says, this is
real. Maybe she doesn't really exist, but just thinking about her makes my heart--my
flesh and blood, my real heart--thump like mad. These feelings are as real as the blood
all over my chest that awful night.
As it gets near closing time Miss Saeki comes downstairs, her heels clicking as
she walks. When I see her, I tense up and can hear my heart pounding. I see the fifteenyear-
old girl inside her. Like some small animal in hibernation, she's curled up in a
hollow inside Miss Saeki, asleep.
Miss Saeki's asking me something but I can't reply. I don't even know what she
said. I can hear her, of course--her words vibrate my eardrums and transmit a message to
my brain that's converted into language--but there's a disconnect between words and
meaning. Flustered, I blush and stammer out something stupid. Oshima intervenes and
answers her question. I nod at what he's saying. Miss Saeki smiles, says good-bye to us,
and leaves for home. I listen to the sound of her Golf as it exits the parking lot, fades
into the distance, and disappears.
Oshima stays behind and helps me close up for the night.
"By any chance have you fallen in love with somebody?" he asks. "You seem
kind of out of it."
I don't have any idea how I should respond. "Oshima," I finally say, "this is a
pretty weird thing to ask, but do you think it's possible for someone to become a ghost
while they're still alive?"
He stops straightening up the counter and looks at me. "A very interesting
question, actually. Are you asking about the human spirit in a literary sense--
metaphorically, in other words? Or do you mean in actual fact?"
"More in actual fact, I guess," I say.
"The assumption that ghosts really exist?"
"Right."
Oshima removes his glasses, wipes them with his handkerchief, and puts them
back on. "That's what's called a 'living spirit.' I don't know about in foreign countries,
but that kind of thing appears a lot in Japanese literature. The Tale of Genji, for instance,
is filled with living spirits. In the Heian period--or at least in its psychological realm--on
occasion people could become living spirits and travel through space to carry out
whatever desires they had. Have you read Genji?"
I shake my head.
"Our library has a couple of modern translations, so it might be a good idea to
read one. Anyway, an example is when Lady Rokujo--she's one of Prince Genji's lovers-
-becomes so consumed with jealousy over Genji's main wife, Lady Aoi, that she turns
into an evil spirit that possesses her. Night after night she attacks Lady Aoi in her bed
until she finally kills her. Lady Aoi was pregnant with Genji's child, and that news is
what activated Lady Rokujo's hatred. Genji called in priests to exorcise the evil spirit,
but to no avail. The evil spirit was impossible to resist.
"But the most interesting part of the story is that Lady Rokujo had no inkling that
she'd become a living spirit. She'd have nightmares and wake up, only to discover that
her long black hair smelled like smoke. Not having any idea what was going on, she was
totally confused. In fact, this smoke came from the incense the priests lit as they prayed
for Lady Aoi. Completely unaware of it, she'd been flying through space and passing
down the tunnel of her subconscious into Aoi's bedroom. This is one of the most
uncanny and thrilling episodes in Genji. Later, when Lady Rokujo learns what she's
been doing, she regrets the sins she's committed and shaves off her hair and renounces
the world.
"The world of the grotesque is the darkness within us. Well before Freud and
Jung shined a light on the workings of the subconscious, this correlation between
darkness and our subconscious, these two forms of darkness, was obvious to people. It
wasn't a metaphor, even. If you trace it back further, it wasn't even a correlation. Until
Edison invented the electric light, most of the world was totally covered in darkness.
The physical darkness outside and the inner darkness of the soul were mixed together,
with no boundary separating the two. They were directly linked. Like this." Oshima
brings his two hands together tightly.
"In Murasaki Shikibu's time living spirits were both a grotesque phenomenon and
a natural condition of the human heart that was right there with them. People of that
period probably couldn't conceive of these two types of darkness as separate from each
other. But today things are different. The darkness in the outside world has vanished, but
the darkness in our hearts remains, virtually unchanged. Just like an iceberg, what we
label the ego or consciousness is, for the most part, sunk in darkness. And that
estrangement sometimes creates a deep contradiction or confusion within us."
"Around your mountain cabin--that's real darkness."
"Absolutely," Oshima says. "Real darkness still exists there. Sometimes I go there
just to experience it."
"What triggers people to become living spirits? Is it always something negative?"
"I'm no expert, but as far as I know, yes, those living spirits all spring up out of
negative emotions. Most of the extreme feelings people have tend to be at once very
individual and very negative. And these living spirits arise through a kind of
spontaneous generation. Sad to say, there aren't any cases of a living spirit emerging to
fulfill some logical premise or bring about world peace."
"What about because of love?"
Oshima sits down and thinks it over. "That's a tough one. All I can tell you is I've
never run across an example. Of course, there is that tale, 'The Chrysanthemum Pledge,'
in Tales of Moonlight and Rain. Have you read it?"
"No," I reply.
"Tales of Moonlight and Rain was written in the late Edo period by a man named
Ueda Akinari. It was set, however, in the earlier Warring States period, which makes
Ueda's approach a bit nostalgic or retro. Anyway, in this particular story two samurai
become fast friends and pledge themselves as blood brothers. For samurai this was very
serious. Being blood brothers meant they pledged their lives to each other. They lived
far away from each other, each serving a different lord. One wrote to the other saying no
matter what, he would visit when the chrysanthemums were in bloom. The other said
he'd wait for his arrival. But before the first one could set out on the journey, he got
mixed up in some trouble in his domain, was put under confinement, and wasn't allowed
to go out or send a letter. Finally summer is over and fall is upon them, the season when
the chrysanthemums blossom. At this rate he won't be able to fulfill his promise to his
friend. To a samurai, nothing's more important than a promise. Honor's more important
than your life. So this samurai commits hara-kiri, becomes a spirit, and races across the
miles to visit his friend. They sit near the chrysanthemums and talk to their heart's
content, and then the spirit vanishes from the face of the earth. It's a beautiful tale."
"But he had to die in order to become a spirit."
"Yes, that's right," Oshima says. "It would appear that people can't become living
spirits out of honor or love or friendship. To do that they have to die. People throw away
their lives for honor, love, or friendship, and only then do they turn into spirits. But
when you talk about living spirits--well, that's a different story. They always seem to be
motivated by evil."
I mull this over.
"But like you said, there might be examples," Oshima continues, "of people
becoming living spirits out of positive feelings of love. I just haven't done much
research into the matter, I'm afraid. Maybe it happens. Love can rebuild the world, they
say, so everything's possible when it comes to love."
"Have you ever been in love?" I ask.
He stares at me, taken aback. "What do you think? I'm not a starfish or a pepper
tree. I'm a living, breathing human being. Of course I've been in love."
"That isn't what I mean," I say, blushing.
"I know," he says, and smiles at me gently.
Once Oshima leaves I go back to my room, switch the stereo to 45 rpm, lower the
needle, and listen to "Kafka on the Shore," following the lyrics on the jacket.
You sit at the edge of the world,
I am in a crater that's no more.
Words without letters
Standing in the shadow of the door.
The moon shines down on a sleeping lizard,
Little fish rain down from the sky.
Outside the window there are soldiers, steeling themselves to die.
(Refrain)
Kafka sits in a chair by the shore,
Thinking of the pendulum that moves the world, it seems.
When your heart is closed,
The shadow of the unmoving Sphinx,
Becomes a knife that pierces your dreams.
The drowning girl's fingers
Search for the entrance stone, and more.
Lifting the hem of her azure dress,
She gazes-- at Kafka on the shore.
I listen to the record three times. First of all, I'm wondering how a record with
lyrics like this could sell over a million copies. I'm not saying they're totally obscure,
just kind of abstract and surreal. Not exactly catchy lyrics. But if you listen to them a
few times they begin to sound familiar. One by one the words find a home in my heart.
It's a weird feeling. Images beyond any meaning arise like cutout figures and stand alone,
just like when I'm in the middle of a deep dream.
The melody is beautiful, simple but different, too. And Miss Saeki's voice melts
into it naturally. Her voice needs more power--she isn't what you'd call a professional
singer--but it gently cleanses your mind, like a spring rain washing over stepping stones
in a garden. She played the piano and sang, then they added a small string section and an
oboe. The recording budget must have kept the arrangement simple, but actually it's this
simplicity that gives the song its appeal.
Two unusual chords appear in the refrain. The other chords in the song are
nothing special, but these two are different, not the kind you can figure out by listening
just a couple of times. At first I felt confused. To exaggerate a little, I felt betrayed, even.
The total unexpectedness of the sounds shook me, unsettled me, like when a cold wind
suddenly blows in through a crack. But once the refrain is over, that beautiful melody
returns, taking you back to that original world of harmony and intimacy. No more chilly
wind here. The piano plays its final note while the strings quietly hold the last chord, the
lingering sound of the oboe bringing the song to a close.
Listening to it over and over, I start to get some idea why "Kafka on the Shore"
moved so many people. The song's direct and gentle at the same time, the product of a
capable yet unselfish heart. There's a kind of miraculous feel to it, this overlap of
opposites. A shy nineteen-year-old girl from a provincial town writes lyrics about her
boyfriend far away, sits down at the piano and sets it to music, then unhesitantly sings
her creation. She didn't write the song for others to hear, but for herself, to warm her
own heart, if even a little. And her self-absorption strikes a subtle but powerful chord in
her listeners' hearts.
I throw together a simple dinner from things in the fridge, then put "Kafka on the
Shore" on the turntable again. Eyes closed, I sit in the chair and try to picture the
nineteen-year-old Miss Saeki in the studio, playing the piano and singing. I think about
the love she felt as she sang. And how mindless violence severed that love forever.
The record is over, the needle lifts up and returns to its cradle.
Miss Saeki may have written the lyrics to "Kafka on the Shore" in this very room.
The more I listen to the record, the more I'm sure that this Kafka on the shore is the
young boy in the painting on the wall. I sit at the desk and, like she did last night, hold
my chin in my hands and gaze at the same angle at the painting right in front of me. I'm
positive now, this had to be where she wrote it. I see her gazing at the painting,
remembering the young boy, writing the poem she then set to music. It had to have been
at night, when it was pitch-dark outside.
I stand up, go over to the wall, and examine the painting up close. The young man
is looking off in the distance, his eyes full of a mysterious depth. In one corner of the
sky there are some sharply outlined clouds, and the largest sort of looks like a crouching
Sphinx.
I search my memory. The Sphinx was the enemy Oedipus defeated by solving the
riddle, and once the monster knew it had lost, it leaped off a cliff and killed itself.
Thanks to this exploit, Oedipus got to be king of Thebes and ended up marrying his own
mother. And the name Kafka. I suspect Miss Saeki used it since in her mind the
mysterious solitude of the boy in the picture overlapped with Kafka's fictional world.
That would explain the title: a solitary soul straying by an absurd shore.
Other lines overlap with things that happened to me. The part about "little fish
rain from the sky"--isn't that exactly what happened in that shopping area back home,
when hundreds of sardines and mackerel rained down? The part about how the shadow
"becomes a knife that pierces your dreams"--that could be my father's stabbing. I copy
down all the lines of the song in my notebook and study them, underlining parts that
particularly interest me. But in the end it's all too suggestive, and I don't know what to
make of it.
Words without letters
Standing in the shadow of the door...
The drowning girl's fingers
Search for the entrance stone...
Outside the window there are soldiers, steeling themselves to die....
What could it mean? Were all these just coincidences? I walk to the window and
look out at the garden. Darkness is just settling in on the world. I go over to the reading
room, sit on the sofa, and open up Tanizaki's translation of The Tale of Genji. At ten I
go to bed, turn off the bedside light, and close my eyes, waiting for the fifteen-year-old
Miss Saeki to return to this room.
Chapter 24
It was already eight p. m. when their bus from Kobe arrived in front of Tokushima
Station.
Well, Mr. Nakata, here we are. Shikoku."
"What a wonderful bridge. Nakata's never seen such a huge one before."
The two of them alighted from the bus and sat down on a bench at the station to
survey their surroundings.
"So--did you have a message from God or something?" Hoshino asked. "Telling
you where you're supposed to go now? What you're supposed to do?"
"No. Nakata still has no idea."
"Great..."
Nakata rubbed his head deliberately with his palm for a while, as if pondering
weighty matters. "Mr. Hoshino?" he finally said.
"What's up?"
"I'm sorry, but Nakata really needs to go to sleep. I'm so sleepy I feel like I could
fall asleep right here."
"Wait a sec--you can't fall asleep here," Hoshino said, flustered. "Tell you what,
I'll find a place where you can sack out, okay? Just hang in there for a while."
"All right. Nakata will hang in there and try not to go to sleep."
"Good. Are you hungry?"
"No, just sleepy."
Hoshino quickly located the tourist information counter, found an inexpensive inn
that included complimentary breakfast, and called to book a room. It was some distance
from the station, so they hailed a cab. As soon as they arrived, Hoshino asked the maid
to lay out their futons for them.
Nakata skipped taking a bath and undressed, lay down in bed, and in an instant
was peacefully snoring away. "I'll probably sleep for a long time, so don't be alarmed,"
he said just before he fell asleep.
"Hey, I'm not going to bother you--sleep as much as you want," Hoshino said, but
Nakata was already lost to the world.
Hoshino enjoyed a leisurely bath, went out, and strolled around to get the lay of
the land, then ducked inside a sushi shop for dinner and a beer. He wasn't much of a
drinker, and a medium-size bottle of beer was enough to turn his face bright red and put
him in a good mood. After dinner he played pachinko and lost twenty-five dollars in a
hour. His Chunichi Dragons baseball cap drew a few stares from passersby, and he
decided he must be the only one in Tokushima wearing one.
Back at the inn he found Nakata just as he'd left him, sound asleep. The light was
on in the room, but that obviously didn't seem to bother him. What an easygoing old guy,
Hoshino concluded. He took off his cap, his aloha shirt, and his jeans, then crawled into
bed and turned out the light. But he felt worked up, and the combination of this and his
new surroundings kept him from falling asleep. Jeez, he thought, maybe I should've
found a hooker and got laid. But as he listened to Nakata's tranquil, regular breathing, he
was suddenly embarrassed by the thought, though he wasn't sure why.
Staring at the ceiling in the dark, lying in bed in a cheap inn in a town he'd never
been to before next to a strange old guy he knew nothing about, he began to have doubts
about himself. By this time of night he should've been driving back to Tokyo, now
somewhere around Nagoya. He didn't dislike his job, and there was a girl in Tokyo who
always made time for him if he wanted to see her. Still, on an impulse, as soon as he'd
unloaded his cargo of furniture in Kobe, he'd called another driver he knew in town and
asked him to take his place and drive his rig back to Tokyo. He phoned his company and
managed to wrangle three days off, and then it was off to Shikoku with Nakata. All he
had along was a small bag with a shaving kit and a change of clothes.
Hoshino originally was intrigued by the resemblance between the old man and his
late grandfather, but that impression had faded, and now he was more curious about
Nakata himself. The things the old guy talked about, and even how he talked, were
definitely strange, but in an interesting way. He had to find out where the old man was
going, and what he'd end up doing when he got there.
Hoshino was born into a farming family, the third of five sons. Up until junior
high he was well behaved, but after entering a trade school he fell in with a bad crowd
and started getting in trouble. The police hauled him in a few times. He was able to
graduate but couldn't find a decent job--and trouble with a girl only compounded his
difficulties--so he decided to join the Self-Defense Force. Though he was hoping to be a
tank driver, he didn't make the cut and spent most of his time driving large transport
trucks. After three years in the SDF he got out and found a job with a trucking company,
and for the last six years he'd been driving for a living.
This suited him. He'd always loved machines, and when he was perched high up
in the cab with his hands on the wheel, it was like he was in his own private little
kingdom. The job's long hard hours were tiring, but he knew he couldn't stand a regular
company job, commuting to a dingy office every morning only to have a boss watch his
every move like a hawk.
He'd always been the feisty type who got into fights. He was skinny and on the
short side, not very tough looking, but in his case looks were deceiving. He was
deceptively strong, and once he reached the breaking point a crazed look would come
over him that sent most opponents scurrying for cover. He'd gotten into a lot of fights,
both as a soldier and as a truck driver, but only recently had started to understand that
this, win or lose, never accomplished very much. At least, he thought proudly, he'd
never had any serious injuries.
During his wild high school days, his grandfather was always the one who'd show
up at the local precinct, bowing apologetically to the police, and they'd release Hoshino
into his custody. They always stopped at a restaurant on the way home, his grandfather
treating him to a delicious meal. He never lectured Hoshino, even then. Not once did his
parents come to get him. They were just barely scraping by and didn't have the time or
energy to worry about their no-good third son. Hoshino sometimes wondered what
would've happened to him if his grandfather hadn't been there to bail him out. The old
man, at least, knew he was alive and worried about him.
Despite all this, he'd never once thanked his grandfather for all he'd done. He
didn't know what to say, and was also too preoccupied trying to get by. His grandfather
died of cancer soon after Hoshino joined the Self-Defense Force. At the end he got
senile and didn't even recognize him. Hoshino hadn't been back home once since the old
man passed away.
When Hoshino woke up at eight the next morning, Nakata was still fast asleep
and looked like he hadn't budged an inch all night. The volume and pace of his breathing,
too, was unchanged. Hoshino went downstairs and ate breakfast with the other guests. A
pretty bare-bones meal, though there were unlimited seconds on miso soup and rice.
"Will your companion be eating breakfast?" the maid called out.
"He's still out cold. Looks like he won't be needing breakfast. If you don't mind,
could you not put away the futon for a while?"
At noon, with Nakata still fast asleep, Hoshino arranged for them to stay one
more night. He went out to a soba place and had chicken and egg over rice. Afterward
he strolled around for a while and wound up in a coffee shop, where he had a cup and a
smoke and flipped through a few of the comic books.
When he got back to the inn, just before two, he found Nakata still hadn't woken
up. Concerned, he felt the old man's forehead, but he didn't seem to have a fever. His
breathing was calm and regular, and his cheeks had a healthy glow to them. He seemed
perfectly fine. All he was doing was sleeping soundly, without ever even turning over in
bed.
"Is he all right, sleeping this much?" the maid said when she looked in on them.
"Maybe he's ill?"
"He's exhausted," Hoshino explained. "Let's just let him sleep as much as he
wants."
"Okay, but I've never seen anybody sleep so much before...."
Dinnertime came and the sleep marathon continued. Hoshino went out to a curry
restaurant and had an extra-large order of beef curry and a salad. After this he went to
the same pachinko place as the night before and again played for an hour. This time,
though, his luck changed, and for under ten dollars he won two cartons of Marlboros. It
was nine-thirty by the time he got back to the inn with his winnings, and he couldn't
believe his eyes--Nakata was still asleep.
Hoshino added up the hours. The old man had been sleeping for over twenty-four
hours. Sure, he said he'd sleep a long time, so not to worry, but this was ridiculous!
Hoshino felt uncharacteristically helpless. Suppose the old guy never woke up? What
the hell was he supposed to do then?
"Cripes," he said, and shook his head.
But the next morning, when Hoshino woke up at seven, Nakata was already
awake, gazing out the window.
"Hey, Gramps, so you finally made it up, huh?" Hoshino said, relieved.
"Yes, Nakata just woke up. I don't know how long I slept, but it must have been a
long time. I feel like a new man."
"No kidding it was a long time! You went to sleep at nine p. m. the day before
yesterday, so you've been asleep something like thirty-four hours. You're a regular Snow
White."
"Nakata's kind of hungry."
"I bet you are. You haven't had a bite in two days."
The two of them went downstairs to the dining room and had breakfast. Nakata
amazed the maid at how much rice he packed away.
"You're as big an eater as you are a sleeper!" she exclaimed. "It's like two days'
worth of meals in one sitting!"
"Yes, I have to eat a lot now."
"You're a really healthy person, aren't you?"
"Yes, Nakata is. I can't read, but I've never had a single cavity and don't need
glasses. I never have to go to the doctor, either. My shoulders never get stiff, and I take a
good dump every morning."
"Isn't that something," the maid said, impressed. "By the way, what's on your
schedule for today?"
"We're headed west," Nakata declared.
"West," she mused. "That must mean you're going toward Takamatsu."
"I'm not so bright and don't know geography."
"Anyway, Gramps, why don't we go over to Takamatsu?" Hoshino chimed in.
"We can figure out what's next after we get there."
"All right. Let's go to Takamatsu, then. We'll figure out what's next after we get
there."
"Sort of a unique style of traveling, I must say," the maid commented.
"You got that right," Hoshino said.
Back in their room, Nakata went to the toilet, while Hoshino, still in his yukata
robe, lay back on the tatami and watched the news on TV. Not much was happening.
Police still didn't have any leads in the murder of a famous sculptor in Nakano--no clues,
no witnesses. The police were searching for the man's fifteen-year-old son, who'd
disappeared shortly before the murder.
Man alive, Hoshino thought, a fifteen-year-old kid. Why is it that these days it's
always fifteen-year-olds who're involved in all these violent incidents? Of course when
he was fifteen himself, he stole a motorcycle from a parking lot and went for a joyride--
without, mind you, a license--so he had no right to complain. Not that you could
compare borrowing a motorcycle and slicing your dad into sashimi. It was only luck,
maybe, that had kept him from stabbing his own father, because he'd certainly taken his
share of beatings.
The news was just winding up when Nakata emerged from the bathroom. "Mr.
Hoshino, may I ask you something?"
"What's up?"
"Does your back hurt at all?"
"Yeah, it's an occupational hazard, I guess. Every trucker I know has back
problems, just like pitchers all have sore shoulders. Why do you ask?"
"When I saw your back I thought maybe you had that problem."
"Huh..."
"Do you mind if Nakata touches your back?"
"Be my guest."
Hoshino lay facedown and Nakata straddled him. He put his hands just above the
backbone and held them there. All the while Hoshino was watching some afternoon talk
show featuring all the latest celebrity gossip. A famous actress had just gotten engaged
to a not-so-famous young novelist. Hoshino didn't care, but there wasn't anything else on.
Apparently the actress's income was ten times that of the novelist, who wasn't even
particularly handsome or very intelligent looking.
Hoshino found the whole thing suspect. "That marriage won't work out, I can tell
you that. There's gotta be some kind of misunderstanding going on here."
"Mr. Hoshino, your bones are out of line a bit."
"Not surprising, what with the out-of-line kind of life I've led," Hoshino replied,
and yawned.
"It's going to cause all sorts of problems if you don't do something about it."
"You think?"
"You'll get headaches, you won't be able to take a good dump. And then your
back will go out on you."
"That can't be good."
"This will hurt a little. Do you mind?"
"No, go right ahead."
"Honestly speaking, it's going to hurt a lot."
"Look, Gramps, I've been punched out my whole life--at home, at school, in the
SDF--but I survived. Not to brag or anything, but the days I haven't been hit I could
count on both hands. So I'm not worried that something might hurt a little. Hot or tickly,
sweet or spicy--bring it on."
Nakata squinted, concentrating, carefully making sure he had his thumbs just
where he wanted them. Once they were positioned just right, he ever so slowly increased
the pressure, gauging Hoshino's reaction. He breathed in deeply, then let out a clipped
cry like some winter bird's squawk, and pressed down with all his might on the area
between muscle and backbone. The pain Hoshino felt at that instant was awful,
unreasonably so. A huge flash of light went off in his brain and everything went white.
He stopped breathing. It felt like he'd been thrown from the top of a tall tower into the
depths of hell. He couldn't even manage a scream, so hideous was the pain. All thoughts
had burned up and shot away. It was like his body had been shattered into pieces. Even
death couldn't be this awful, he felt. He tried to open his eyes but couldn't. He just lay
there, helpless, facedown on the tatami, drooling, tears streaming down his face. He
must have endured this for some thirty seconds or so.
Finally he was able to breathe again, and he staggered as he sat up. The tatami
wavered before him like the sea in a storm.
"I'm sure it was painful."
Hoshino shook his head a few times, as if checking to see that he was still alive.
"Pain doesn't begin to describe it. Imagine getting skinned alive, skewered, ground down,
then run over by an angry herd of bulls. What the hell did you do to me?"
"I put your bones back in the right position. You should be fine for the time being.
Your back won't ache. And I guarantee you'll take good dumps."
As predicted, when the pain receded, like the tide going out, his back did feel
better. The usual heavy, sluggish feeling had vanished. The area around his temples felt
much better, and he could breathe more easily. And sure enough, he felt like going to
the john.
"Yeah, I guess certain parts do feel better."
"The problem was all in the spine," Nakata said.
"But damn did that hurt," Hoshino said, and sighed.
The two of them took the JR express train from Tokushima Station bound for
Takamatsu. Hoshino paid for everything, the inn and the train fare. Nakata insisted on
paying his share, but Hoshino wouldn't hear of it.
"I'll pay now, and we can settle up later. I don't like it when men go all to pieces
over money, okay?"
"All right. Nakata doesn't understand money very well, so I'll do as you say,"
Nakata said.
"I gotta tell you, though, I feel great, thanks to that shiatsu you did on me. So at
least let me pay you back for it, okay? I haven't felt this good in I don't know how long.
I feel like a new man."
"That's wonderful. Nakata doesn't know what shiatsu means, but I do know how
important the bones are."
"I'm not sure what you call it either--shiatsu, bone-setting, chiropractic--but
whatever it is, you've really got a talent for it. You could make a lot of money doing this.
You could make a bundle just doing all my trucker buddies."
"As soon as I saw your back I could tell the bones were out of line. When I see
something out of line I like to set it right. I made furniture for a long time and whenever
I saw something crooked I just had to straighten it out. That's just how Nakata is. But
this was the first time I straightened out bones."
"I guess you're a natural," Hoshino said, impressed.
"Nakata used to be able to speak with cats."
"No kidding?"
"But not so long ago I couldn't talk with them anymore. It must be Johnnie
Walker's fault."
"I see."
"I'm stupid, so I don't understand difficult things. And there have been so many
difficult things happening lately. Fish and leeches falling from the sky, for instance."
"Really?"
"But I'm glad I could make your back better. If you feel good, then Nakata feels
good."
"I'm really happy, too," Hoshino said.
"That's good."
"Now that you mention those leeches..."
"Yes, Nakata remembers that very well."
"Did you have something to do with that?"
Nakata thought about it for a while, a rare occurrence. "I don't really know myself.
All I know is when I opened my umbrella it started to rain leeches."
"What'ya know...."
"The worst thing of all is killing other people," Nakata said, and gave a decisive
nod.
"Absolutely. Killing is bad, for sure."
"That's right," Nakata said again, nodding forcefully.
The two of them got out at Takamatsu Station, then slipped inside a noodle place
near the station and had udon for lunch. Outside the restaurant window there were
several large cranes on the docks, covered with seagulls.
Nakata methodically enjoyed each and every noodle. "This udon is delicious," he
said.
"Glad you like it," Hoshino said. "So, what do you think? Is this spot okay?"
"Yes, Nakata thinks it will do."
"So we got the right spot picked out. Now what are you going to do?"
"I've got to find the entrance stone."
"Entrance stone?"
"That's right."
"Hmm," Hoshino said. "I bet there's a long story behind that."
Nakata tilted his bowl and drained the last drop of soup. "Yes, it is a long story.
But it's so long I don't understand it myself. Once we get there, though, Nakata thinks
we'll understand."
"As usual, you gotta be there to get it?"
"Yes, that's right."
"Until we go there I won't understand it."
"Yes. Until we go there I won't understand it either."
"Enough already. I don't like long stories. Anyway, I guess we need to find this
entrance stone thing."
"That is correct," Nakata said.
"So where is it?"
"Nakata has no idea."
"Like I had to ask," Hoshino said, shaking his head.
Chapter 25
I fall asleep for a short time, wake up, fall asleep again, wake up, over and over. I don't
want to miss the moment she appears. But I do miss it--I look up and she's already
seated at the desk, just like last night. The clock next to my bed shows a little past three.
I'm positive I closed the curtains before going to bed, but again they're wide open. But
there's no moon tonight--that's the only difference. There's a heavy cloud cover, and it
might be drizzling outside. The room's much darker than last night, with only distant
lamps in the garden casting a faint light between the trees. It takes a while for my eyes
to adjust.
The girl is seated at the desk, head in her hands, gazing at the painting. She's
wearing the same clothes as last night. Even if I squint and look hard, this time it's too
dark to make out her face. Strangely enough, though, her body and silhouette stand out,
floating there clearly in the darkness. The girl is Miss Saeki when she was young--I have
absolutely no doubt about it.
She looks deep in thought. Or in the midst of a long, deep dream. Check that--
maybe she herself is Miss Saeki's long, deep dream. At any rate, I try to breathe very
quietly so as not to disturb the balance of this scene before me. I don't move an inch, just
glance occasionally at the clock to check the time. Time passes slowly, regularly.
Out of the blue my heart starts beating hard, a dry sound like somebody's
knocking at the door. The sound echoes through the silent, dead-of-night room, and
startles me so much that I nearly leap right out of bed.
The girl's black silhouette moves ever so slightly. She looks up and listens in the
dark. She's heard it--the sound of my heart. She tilts her head just a fraction, for all the
world like an animal in the woods focusing on an unexpected, unknown sound. Then she
turns to face me in bed. But I don't register in her eyes, I can tell. I'm not in her dream.
She and I are in two separate worlds, divided by an invisible boundary.
Just as quickly as it came on, my pounding heart settles back down to normal.
And so does my breathing. I'm back to being invisible, and she's no longer listening. Her
gaze falls back on Kafka on the Shore. Head in hands like before, her heart is drawn
once more toward the boy in that summer scene.
She's there for about twenty minutes, then vanishes. Just like last night, she stands
up, barefoot, noiselessly glides toward the door, and, without opening it, disappears
outside. I sit still for a while, then finally get up. Keeping the light off, I go over in the
darkness and sit down on the seat she just occupied. I rest both hands on the desk and
absorb the afterglow of her presence. I close my eyes, scooping up her shivering heart,
letting it seep inside mine. I keep my eyes closed.
There's one thing, I discover, the girl and I have in common. We're both in love
with someone who's no longer of this world.
A short time later I fall into a restless sleep. My body needs rest, but my mind
won't allow it. I swing like a pendulum, back and forth between the two. Later, though--
I'm not even sure if it's light out or not--birds begin making a racket in the garden, and
their voices pull me completely awake.
I tug on jeans and pull a long-sleeved shirt over my T-shirt and go outside. It's
after five o'clock and nobody else is up. I walk out of the old-looking town, through the
pine forest set up as a windbreak, past the seawall and out onto the beach. There's barely
a breeze against my skin. The sky's covered with a layer of gray clouds, but it doesn't
look like it's going to rain anytime soon. It's a quiet, still morning. Like a layer of
soundproofing, the clouds absorb every sound the earth sends up.
I walk for a while on a path that parallels the sea, picturing the boy in the painting
walking the same path, canvas chair in hand, sitting on the shore. I'm not sure, though,
what scene along this shore the painting depicts. The painting only shows the beach, the
horizon, sky, and clouds. And an island. But there are a number of islands along the
shore, and I can't exactly recall what the one in the painting looked like. I sit down on
the sand, face the sea, and make a kind of picture frame with my hands. I imagine the
boy sitting there. A single white seagull flits aimlessly across the windless sky. Small
waves break against the shore at regular intervals, leaving behind a gentle curve and tiny
bubbles on the sand.
All of a sudden I realize--I'm jealous of the boy in the painting.
"You're jealous of the boy in the painting," the boy called Crow whispers in my
ear.
You're jealous of that pitiful, twenty-year-old boy mistaken for someone else and
pointlessly murdered--what is it, thirty years ago? So insanely jealous it hurts. This is
the first time you've ever been jealous in your life. Now you finally understand what it
feels like. It's like a brush fire torching your heart.
You've never ever in your life envied anybody else, or ever wanted to be someone
else--but right now you do. You want more than anything to be that boy. Even knowing
that at age twenty he was going to be smashed over the head with an iron pipe and
beaten to death, you'd still trade places with him. You'd do it, to be able to love Miss
Saeki for those five years. And to have her love you with all her heart. To hold her as
much as you want, to make love to her over and over. To let your fingers run over every
single part of her body, and let her do the same to you. And after you die, your love will
become a story etched forever in her heart. Every single night she'll love you in her
memory.
Yup, you're in a strange position, all right. You're in love with a girl who is no
more, jealous of a boy who's gone forever. Even so, this emotion you're feeling is more
real, and more intensely painful, than anything you've ever felt before. And there's no
way out. No possibility of finding an exit. You've wandered into a labyrinth of time, and
the biggest problem of all is that you have no desire at all to get out. Am I right?
Oshima comes in a little later than yesterday. Before he does I vacuum the first
and second floors, wipe down all the desks and chairs, open the windows and clean
them, wash out the restroom, throw out the garbage, pour fresh water in the vases. Then
I turn on all the lights and switch on the catalog computers. All that's left is to open the
front gate.
Oshima checks my work and gives a satisfied nod. "You learn pretty quick, and
don't fool around, do you?"
I boil some water and make him some coffee. Like yesterday, I have a cup of Earl
Grey. It's started raining outside, pretty heavily. You can hear thunder off in the distance.
It's not yet noon, but it's like evening it's so dark.
"Oshima, I have something I'd like you to do for me."
"What's that?"
"Can you get hold of the sheet music for 'Kafka on the Shore' somewhere?"
Oshima thinks it over. "As long as it's on a music publisher's website, I imagine
you could download it for a fee. I'll check it out and let you know."
"Thanks."
He sits down on a corner of the counter, puts the tiniest lump of sugar into his
coffee cup, then carefully stirs it with a spoon. "So you like the song?"
"Yeah, a lot."
"I'm fond of it myself. It's a lovely tune, quite unique. Simple yet deep. It tells
you a lot about the person who composed it."
"The lyrics, though, are pretty symbolic," I venture.
"From time immemorial, symbolism and poetry have been inseparable. Like a
pirate and his rum."
"Do you think Miss Saeki knew what all the lyrics mean?"
Oshima looks up, listening to the thunder as if calculating how far away it is. He
turns to me and shakes his head. "Not necessarily. Symbolism and meaning are two
separate things. I think she found the right words by bypassing procedures like meaning
and logic. She captured words in a dream, like delicately catching hold of a butterfly's
wings as it flutters around. Artists are those who can evade the verbose."
"So you're saying Miss Saeki maybe found those words in some other space--like
in dreams?"
"Most great poetry is like that. If the words can't create a prophetic tunnel
connecting them to the reader, then the whole thing no longer functions as a poem."
"But plenty of poems only pretend to do that."
"Right. It's a kind of trick, and as long as you know that it isn't hard. As long as
you use some symbolic-sounding words, the whole thing looks like a poem of sorts."
"In 'Kafka on the Shore' I feel something urgent and serious."
"Me too," Oshima says. "The words aren't just something on the surface. But the
words and melody are so inseparable in my mind, I can't look at the lyrics as pure poetry
and decide how persuasive they are by themselves." He shakes his head slightly. "At any
rate, she was definitely blessed with a natural talent, and had a real sense for music. She
was also practical enough to grab an opportunity when it came along. If that terrible
incident hadn't taken her out of circulation, I'm sure she would've developed her talent
even further. In any number of ways it's a real shame...."
"So where did all that talent go?"
Oshima looks at me. "You're asking where Miss Saeki's talent went after her
boyfriend died?"
I nod. "If talent's a kind of natural energy, doesn't it have to find an outlet?"
"I don't know," he replies. "Nobody can predict where talent's headed. Sometimes
it simply vanishes. Other times it sinks down under the earth like an underground stream
and flows off who knows where."
"Maybe Miss Saeki focused her talents somewhere else, other than music," I
venture.
"Somewhere else?" Oshima, obviously interested, narrows his brow. "What do
you mean?"
I'm at a loss for words. "I don't know.... I just feel maybe that's what happened.
Maybe into something intangible."
"Intangible?"
"Something other people can't see, something you pursue for yourself. An inner
process."
Oshima brushes his hair off his forehead, locks of it spilling between his slender
fingers. "That's an interesting idea. For all we know, after Miss Saeki came back to town
maybe she used her talents somewhere out of sight--as you said, for something
intangible. But you have to remember she disappeared for about twenty-five years, so
unless you ask her yourself there's no way of knowing for sure."
I hesitate, then decide to just go ahead. "Can I ask you something really stupid?"
"Really stupid?"
I blush. "Totally off the wall."
"No problem. I don't necessarily mind stupid, off-the-wall things."
"I can't believe I'm actually saying this to somebody."
Oshima tilts his head ever so slightly, waiting for me to go on.
"Is it possible that Miss Saeki... is my mother?"
Oshima leans back against the counter, taking time to search for the right words.
The clock on the wall ticks away as I wait.
Finally he speaks up. "So what you're saying is that when she was twenty, Miss
Saeki left Takamatsu in despair and was living alone someplace when she happened to
meet your father, Koichi Tamura, and they got married. They were blessed with you and
then, four years later, something happened and she ran away, leaving you behind. After
this there's a mysterious blank, but then she shows up back in Shikoku. Do I have that
right?"
"Yeah."
"It's not impossible. What I mean is, at this point I don't have any evidence to
refute your hypothesis. So much of her life is a total mystery. Rumor has it she lived in
Tokyo. Plus she's about the same age as your father. When she came back to Takamatsu,
though, she was alone. How old did you say your sister is?"
"Twenty-one."
"The same age as me," Oshima says. "I'm not your sister--that much I know for
certain. I've got parents, and my brother--all related by blood. A family way too good for
me." He folds his arms and looks me at for a while. "I've got a question for you. Have
you ever looked at your family register? That would give your mother's name and age."
"Of course I have."
"So what did it say?"
"There wasn't any name," I say.
He looks surprised. "No name? How can that be?"
"There wasn't any. No kidding. I have no idea why. As far as the family register's
concerned, I don't have a mother. Or an older sister. There's just my father's name and
mine on the register. Legally, I'm a bastard. An illegitimate child."
"But you actually had a mother and a sister at one time."
I nod. "I did, until I was four. The four of us lived together. It's not just my
imagination. I remember it very clearly. The two of them left soon after I turned four." I
pull out my wallet and show Oshima the photo of me and my sister playing at the shore.
He gazes at it for a moment, smiles, and hands it back.
"'Kafka on the Shore,'" he says.
I nod and put the photograph back in my wallet. The wind swirls outside,
pounding rain against the window. The ceiling light casts a shadow of me and Oshima
on the floor, where we look like we're having an ominous talk in some alternate world.
"You don't remember your mother's face?" Oshima asks. "You lived together till
you were four, so you should have some memory of what she looked like."
I shake my head. "I just can't recall, not at all. I don't know why, but the part of
my memory where her face should be is dark, painted over, blank."
Oshima ponders this for a while. "Tell me more about why you think Miss Saeki
might be your mother."
"That's enough," I say. "Let's just forget it. I'm making too much of it."
"It's all right--go ahead and say what's on your mind," he says. "Then the two of
us can decide if you're making too much of it or not."
Oshima's shadow on the floor moves in time with his movements, though it's
slightly more exaggerated.
"There are an amazing amount of coincidences between me and Miss Saeki," I
say. "They're like pieces of a puzzle that fit together. I understood this when I listened to
'Kafka on the Shore.' First off is the fact that I was drawn to this library, like fate reeling
me in. A straight line from Nakano to Takamatsu. Very strange, when you think about
it."
"Like the plot of a Greek tragedy," Oshima comments.
"Plus," I add, "I'm in love with her."
"With Miss Saeki?"
"Yeah, probably."
"Probably?" Oshima repeats, frowning. "Do you mean it's probably Miss Saeki
you're in love with? Or that you're probably in love with her?"
I turn red. "I can't really explain it," I reply. "It's complicated and there's a lot of
stuff I still don't get."
"But you're probably in love, probably with Miss Saeki?"
"Right," I say. "Very much."
"Probably, but also very much."
I nod.
"At the same time it's possible she's your mother?"
Another of my patented nods.
"For a fifteen-year-old who doesn't even shave yet, you're sure carrying a lot of
baggage around." Oshima takes a sip of his coffee and carefully places the cup back on
its saucer. "I'm not saying that's wrong. Just that everything has a critical point."
I don't say anything.
Oshima touches his temples and is lost in thought for a time. He crosses his slim
fingers together in front of his chest. "I'll try to find that sheet music as soon as I can. I
can finish up here, so why don't you go back to your room."
At lunchtime I take over from Oshima at the front counter. There are fewer
visitors than usual, probably due to the steady rain. When he comes back from his break,
he hands me a large envelope with a computer printout of the sheet music for "Kafka on
the Shore."
"Convenient world we live in," he says.
"Thanks," I tell him.
"If you don't mind, why don't you take a cup of coffee upstairs. No cream or
sugar. You make really good coffee."
I make a fresh cup and take it on a tray to the second floor. As always, the door to
Miss Saeki's room is open and she's at her desk, writing. When I put the cup of coffee on
her desk, she looks up at me and smiles, then puts the cap back on her fountain pen and
rests it on top of the paper.
"So, are you getting used to things around here?"
"Bit by bit," I answer.
"Are you free now?"
"Yes, I am," I tell her.
"Why don't you sit down, then." Miss Saeki points to the wooden chair beside her
desk. "Let's talk for a while."
It's starting to thunder again. Still far away, but gradually getting closer. I do what
she says and take a seat.
"How old are you again? Sixteen?"
"Fifteen. I just turned fifteen," I respond.
"You ran away from home, didn't you?"
"Yes, I did."
"Was there some reason you had to do that?"
I shake my head. What should I say?
Miss Saeki picks up the cup and takes a sip while she waits for my answer.
"I felt like if I stayed there I'd be damaged beyond repair," I say.
"Damaged?" Miss Saeki says, narrowing her eyes.
"Yes," I say.
After a pause she says, "It sounds strange for a boy your age to use a word like
damaged, though I must say I'm intrigued. What exactly do you mean by damaged?"
I search for the right words. First I look for the boy named Crow, but he's
nowhere to be found. I'm left to choose them on my own, and that takes time. But Miss
Saeki waits there patiently. Lightning flashes outside, and after a time thunder booms far
away.
"I mean I'd change into something I shouldn't."
Miss Saeki looks at me with great interest. "As long as there's such a thing as time,
everybody's damaged in the end, changed into something else. It always happens, sooner
or later."
"But even if that happens, you've got to have a place you can retrace your steps
to."
"A place you can retrace your steps to?"
"A place that's worth coming back to."
Miss Saeki stares straight at me.
I blush, then summon my courage and look up at her. She has on a navy blue
dress with short sleeves. She must have a whole closet of dresses in different shades of
blue. Her only accessories are a thin silver necklace and a smallish wristwatch with a
black leather band. I look for the fifteen-year-old girl in her and find her right away.
She's hidden, asleep, like a 3-D painting in the forest of her heart. But if you look
carefully you can spot her. My chest starts pounding again, like somebody's hammering
a long nail into the walls surrounding it.
"For a fifteen-year-old, you make a lot of sense."
I have no idea how to respond to that. So I don't say anything.
"When I was fifteen," Miss Saeki says with a smile, "all I wanted was to go off to
some other world, a place beyond anybody's reach. A place beyond the flow of time."
"But there's no place like that in this world."
"Exactly. Which is why I'm living here, in this world where things are continually
damaged, where the heart is fickle, where time flows past without a break." As if hinting
at the flow of time, she's silent for a while. "But you know," she goes on, "when I was
fifteen, I thought there had to be a place like that in the world. I was sure that
somewhere I'd run across the entrance that would take me to that other world."
"Were you lonely when you were fifteen?"
"In a sense, I guess. I wasn't alone, but I was terribly lonely. Because I knew that
I would never be happier than I was then. That much I knew for sure. That's why I
wanted to go--just as I was--to some place where there was no time."
"What I want is to grow up faster."
Miss Saeki pulls back to study my expression. "You must be much stronger and
more independent than I am. At your age I was filled with illusions of escaping reality,
but you're standing right up to the real world and confronting it head-on. That's a big
difference."
Strong and independent? I'm neither one. I'm just being pushed along by reality,
whether I like it or not. But I don't say anything.
"You know, you remind me of a fifteen-year-old boy I used to know a long time
ago."
"Did he look like me?" I ask.
"You're taller and more muscular than he was, but there is a resemblance. He
didn't enjoy talking with other kids his age--they were on a different wavelength--so he
spent most of his time holed up in his room, reading or listening to music. He'd get the
same frown lines, too, whenever the topic got difficult. And you love to read as well."
I nod.
Miss Saeki glances at her watch. "Thank you for the coffee."
Taking that as my signal to leave, I stand up and head for the door. Miss Saeki
picks up her black fountain pen, slowly twists off the cap, and goes back to her writing.
There's another flash of lightning outside, bathing the room for an instant in a weird
color. The clap of thunder hits a moment later. This time it's closer than before.
"Kafka," Miss Saeki says.
I stop at the doorway and turn around.
"I just remembered that I wrote a book on lightning once."
I don't say anything. A book on lightning?
"I went all over Japan interviewing people who'd survived lightning strikes. It
took me a few years. Most of the interviews were pretty interesting. A small publisher
put it out, but it barely sold. The book didn't come to any conclusion, and nobody wants
to read a book that doesn't have one. For me, though, having no conclusion seemed
perfectly fine."
A tiny hammer in my head is pounding on a drawer somewhere, persistently. I'm
trying to remember something, something very important--but I don't know what it is.
By this time Miss Saeki's gone back to her writing and I go back to my room.
The rainstorm continues to batter us for another hour. The thunder is so incredibly
loud that I'm afraid the windows in the library will shatter. Every time a bolt of lightning
streaks across the sky, the stained-glass window on the landing flashes an image like
some ancient ghost on the white wall across from it. By two o'clock, the storm lets up,
and yellowish light begins to spill out between the clouds like a reconciliation has
finally been reached. Water continues to drip down in the gentle sunlight.
When evening rolls around, I start closing up the place for the night. Miss Saeki
says good-bye to me and Oshima and heads home. I hear the engine of her Golf and
picture her seated at the wheel, turning the key. I tell Oshima I'll finish locking up.
Whistling some aria, he goes off to wash up in the restroom, then leaves. I listen as the
Mazda Miata roars off, the sound fading off in the distance. Now the library's all mine.
It's much quieter than ever before.
I go to my room and study the sheet music for "Kafka on the Shore." Like I
suspected, most of the chords are simple. The refrain, though, has a couple tricky ones. I
go over to the reading room and try playing it on the upright piano. The fingering's
really tough, so I practice it over and over, trying to get my hands around it, and
somehow wind up getting it to sound right. At first the chords sound all wrong. I'm sure
it's a misprint, or that the piano's out of tune. But the longer I listen to how those two
chords sound one after the other, the more I'm convinced the whole song hangs on them.
These two chords are what keep "Kafka on the Shore" from degrading into some silly
pop song, give it a special depth and substance. But how in the world did Miss Saeki
come up with them?
I go back to my room, boil water in the electric kettle, and make some tea. I take
out the old records we found in the storage room and put them on the turntable one after
another. Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, the Beatles' "White Album," Otis Redding's
Dock of the Bay, Stan Getz's Getz/Gilberto--all hit albums from the late sixties. That
young boy--with Miss Saeki right beside him--must've done what I was doing, putting
the records on the turntable, lowering the needle, listening to the music coming out of
these speakers. The music felt like it was taking me and the whole room off to some
different time, a world before I was even born. As I enjoy the music, I review the
conversation we'd had that afternoon, trying to capture our exact words.
"When I was fifteen, I thought there had to be a place like that in the world. I was
sure that somewhere I'd run across the entrance that would take me to that other world."
I can hear her voice right beside me. Inside my head something knocks at a door,
a heavy, persistent knock.
An entrance?
I lift the needle off the Stan Getz album, pull out the single of "Kafka on the
Shore," place it on the turntable, and lower the needle. And listen to her sing.
The drowning girl's fingers
Search for the entrance stone, and more.
Lifting the hem of her azure dress,
She gazes-- at Kafka on the shore.
The girl who comes to this room most likely located that entrance stone. She's in
another world, just as she was at fifteen, and at night she comes to visit this room. In her
light blue dress, she comes to gaze at Kafka on the shore.
Suddenly, completely out of nowhere, I remember my father talking about how
he'd once been struck by lightning. He didn't tell me himself--I'd read about it in an
interview in a magazine. When he was a student in art college, he had a part-time job as
a caddy at a golf course. One day he was following his golfer around the course when
the sky suddenly changed color and a huge thunderstorm crashed down on them. They
took refuge under a tree when it was hit by a bolt of lightning. This huge tree was split
right in two. The golfer he was caddying for was killed, but my father, sensing
something, leaped away from the tree in time. He got some light burns, his hair was
singed, and the shock of the lightning threw him against a rock. He struck his head and
lost consciousness, but survived the ordeal with only a small scar on his forehead. That's
what I was trying to remember this afternoon, standing there in Miss Saeki's doorway
listening to the roar of the thunder. It was after he recovered from his injuries that my
father got serious about his career as a sculptor.
As Miss Saeki went around interviewing people for her book, maybe she met my
father. It's entirely possible. There can't be that many people around who've been struck
by lightning and lived, can there?
I breathe very quietly, waiting for the dawn. A cloud parts, and moonlight shines
down on the trees in the garden. There are just too many coincidences. Everything
seems to be speeding up, rushing toward one destination.
Chapter 26
It was already pretty late in the afternoon, and they had to find a place to stay for the
night. Hoshino went to the tourist information booth at Takamatsu Station and had them
make a reservation at an inn. It was within walking distance of the station, which was
nice, but otherwise was typical and somewhat dumpy. Neither Hoshino nor Nakata
minded much, though. As long as there were futons to sleep on, they were fine. As
before, breakfast was provided but they were on their own for dinner. This particularly
suited Nakata, who was likely to drop off to sleep any time.
Once they were in their room, Nakata had Hoshino lie facedown on the futon, got
on top of him again, and pressed down with both thumbs up and down his lower back,
carefully checking out the condition of his joints and muscles. This time he was much
more gentle, just tracing the spine and checking out how tense the muscles were.
"Something wrong?" Hoshino asked anxiously.
"No, everything's fine. Nakata doesn't find anything wrong with you now. Your
spine's in good shape."
"That's a relief," Hoshino said. "I wasn't looking forward to another torture
session."
"I know. Nakata's really sorry. But you did tell me you didn't mind pain, so I went
ahead and did it as hard as I could."
"Yeah, I know that's what I said. But listen, Gramps, there are limits. Sometimes
you've gotta use common sense. But I guess I shouldn't be complaining--you did fix my
back. But man alive, I never felt anything like that in my life. The pain was
unimaginable! It felt like you were ripping me apart. Like I died and came back to life or
something."
"Nakata was dead for three weeks once."
"No kidding," Hoshino said. Still facedown, he took a gulp of tea and munched
on some crunchy snacks he'd picked up at a convenience store. "So you really were
dead?"
"I was."
"Where were you all that time?"
"Nakata doesn't remember. It felt like I was somewhere far away, doing
something else. But my head was floating and I can't remember anything. Then I came
back to this world and found out I was dumb. I couldn't read or write anymore."
"You must've left your ability to read and write over on the other side."
"Maybe so."
The two of them were silent for a time. Hoshino decided it was best to believe
whatever the old man told him, no matter how eccentric it sounded. At the same time he
felt uneasy, as if pursuing this dead-for-three-weeks idea any further would lead him
into some chaotic, out-of-control situation. Better to turn the conversation back to more
practical matters. "So, now that we're in Takamatsu, Mr. Nakata, where are you
planning to go?"
"I have no idea," Nakata replied. "I don't know what I'm supposed to do."
"What about that entrance stone?"
"That's right! Nakata completely forgot about it. We have to find the stone. But I
don't have a clue where to look. My mind's floating and won't clear up. I wasn't too
bright to begin with, and this kind of thing only makes it worse."
"We're in a bit of a fix, then, aren't we?"
"Yes, I'd say we are."
"Not that sitting here staring at each other's all that much fun. This won't get us
anywhere."
"You're right."
"I think we should go around asking people, you know, if that stone's somewhere
around here."
"If you say so, then that's what Nakata wants to do. I'm pretty dumb, so I'm used
to asking people questions."
"My grandpa always said asking a question is embarrassing for a moment, but not
asking is embarrassing for a lifetime."
"I agree. When you die, everything you know disappears."
"Well, that's not what he meant, exactly," Hoshino said, scratching his head.
"Anyway, do you have a mental image of the stone? What kind of stone it is, how big it
is, its shape or color? What it's used for? If we don't have some details, it's hard to ask.
Nobody's going to know what the heck we're talking about if we just say, Is there an
entrance stone anywhere around here? They'll think we're nuts. You see what I mean?"
"Yes, I do. I might be dumb, but I'm not nuts."
"Okay."
"The stone Nakata's looking for is very special. It's not so big. It's white, and
doesn't have any smell. I don't know what it's used for. It's round, sort of like a rice
cake." He held up his hands to indicate something the size of an LP record.
"Hmm. So if you spotted it, do you think you'd recognize it? You know, like--
Hey, here it is."
"Nakata would know it right away."
"There must be some kind of story or legend behind it. Maybe it's famous and on
display at a shrine or someplace."
"It could be, I suppose."
"Or maybe it's just in some house, and people use it as a weight when they make
pickles."
"No, that's not possible."
"Why not?"
"Because nobody can move the stone."
"Nobody except you, you mean."
"Yes, I think Nakata probably can."
"After you move it, then what?"
Nakata did an uncharacteristic thing--he pondered this for a good long time. At
least he looked like he was, briskly rubbing his short, salt-and-pepper hair. "I don't really
know about that," he finally said. "All I know is it's about time somebody moved it."
Hoshino did some pondering himself. "And that somebody's you, right? At least
for now."
"Yes," Nakata replied, "that's correct."
"Is the stone found only in Takamatsu?"
"No, it isn't. It doesn't really matter where it is. It just happens to be here right
now. It would be much easier if it was in Nakano Ward."
"But moving that kind of stone must be risky."
"That's right. Maybe Nakata shouldn't bring this up, but it is very dangerous."
"Damn," Hoshino said, slowly shaking his head. He put on his Chunichi Dragons
cap and pulled his ponytail out the hole in the back. "This is starting to feel like an
Indiana Jones movie or something."
The next morning they went to the tourist information booth in the station to ask
if there were any famous stones in Takamatsu or the vicinity.
"Stones?" the girl behind the counter said, frowning slightly. She'd been trained to
introduce all the usual tourist places, but nothing beyond that, and the question clearly
had her flustered. "What sort of stones are you looking for?"
"A round stone about so big," Hoshino said, forming his hands in a circle the size
of an LP, just as Nakata had done. "It's called the entrance stone."
"'Entrance stone'?"
"Yep. That's the name. It's pretty famous, I imagine."
"Entrance to what, though?"
"If I knew that I wouldn't have to go to all this trouble."
The girl thought about it for a while. Hoshino gazed at her face the whole time.
Kind of pretty, he judged, though her eyes are a bit too far apart, giving her the look of a
cautious bovine. She made a few calls, but it didn't look like she was getting anywhere.
"I'm sorry," she finally said. "Nobody's heard of a stone by that name."
"Nobody?"
She shook her head. "Excuse me for asking, but are you here just to find this
stone?"
"Yeah, I don't know if it's just to see it. Anyway, I'm from Nagoya. The old guy's
from Nakano Ward in Tokyo."
"Yes, Nakata's from Nakano Ward," Nakata chimed in. "I rode in a lot of trucks,
and even got treated to eel once. I came this far and haven't spent a cent of my own
money."
"I see...," the girl said.
"Not to worry. If nobody's heard about the stone, what're ya gonna do, huh? It's
not your fault. But maybe they call it something else. Are there any other famous stones
around here? You know, something with a legend behind it, maybe? Or some stone
people pray to? Anything like that?"
The girl looked timidly at Hoshino with her too-far-apart eyes, taking in his
Chunichi Dragons cap, his hair and ponytail, his green-tinted sunglasses, pierced ear,
and rayon aloha shirt. "I'd be happy to tell you how to get to the city public library. You
could research the stone there. I don't know much about stones myself, I'm afraid."
The library, however, yielded nothing. There wasn't a single book in the place
devoted to stones in or around Takamatsu. The reference librarian, saying they might
run across a reference somewhere, plunked down a stack of books in front of them:
Legends of Kagawa Prefecture, Legends of Kobo Daishi in Shikoku, A History of
Takamatsu, and the like. Sighing deeply, Hoshino started leafing through them. For his
part, Nakata carefully turned one page after another in a photo collection entitled
Famous Stones of Japan.
"I can't read," he said, "so this is the first library I've ever been in."
"I'm not proud of it," Hoshino said, "but this is a first for me, too. Even though I
can."
"It's kind of interesting now that we're here."
"Glad to hear it."
"There's a library in Nakano Ward. I think I'll stop by there every now and then.
The best thing is they don't charge anything. Nakata had no idea they'd let you in if you
can't read."
"I've got a cousin who was born blind, but he goes to see movies," Hoshino said.
"What fun could that be?"
"I can see, but I've never been to a movie theater."
"You're kidding! I'll have to take you sometime."
The librarian came over and warned them to keep their voices down, so they
stopped talking and went back to their books. When he finished with Famous Stones of
Japan, Nakata put it back on the shelf and began flipping through Cats of the World.
Grumbling all the while, Hoshino managed to look through all the books piled up
next to him. Unfortunately, he couldn't find any matches in any of them. There were
several references to the stone walls of Takamatsu Castle, but the stones in those walls
were so massive that for Nakata to pick one up was out of the question. There was also a
promising legend about Kobo Daishi, a famous scholarly monk of the Heian period. It
was claimed that when he lifted up a stone in a wilderness, a spring gushed out and the
place became a fertile rice field, but that was the end of the story. Hoshino also read
about one shrine that had a stone called the Treasure of Children Stone, but it was more
than a yard tall and shaped like a phallus. No way that could be the one Nakata was
looking for.
The two of them gave up, left the library, and went to a nearby diner for dinner.
They both had noodles topped with tempura, Hoshino ordering an extra bowl of noodles
and broth.
"I enjoyed the library," Nakata said. "I had no idea there were so many kinds of
cats in the world."
"The stone thing didn't pan out, but that's all right," Hoshino told him. "We just
got started. Let's get a good night's sleep and see what tomorrow brings."
The next morning they went back to the library. Like the day before, Hoshino
read through a huge stack of books, one after the other. He'd never read so many books
in his life. By now he was fairly conversant with the history of Shikoku, and he'd
learned that people had worshipped different kinds of stones for centuries. But what he
really wanted--a description of this entrance stone--was nowhere to be found. By
afternoon his head was starting to ache, so they left the library, laid down on the grass in
a park for a long while, and gazed at the clouds drifting by. Hoshino smoked, Nakata
sipped at hot tea from his thermos.
"It's going to thunder again tomorrow," Nakata said.
"Meaning you're going to make it thunder?"
"No, Nakata can't do that. The thunder comes by itself."
"Thank God for that," Hoshino said.
They went back to their inn, took a bath, and then Nakata went to bed and was
soon fast asleep. Hoshino watched a baseball game on TV with the sound down low, but
since the Giants were soundly beating Hiroshima he got disgusted with the whole thing
and turned it off. He wasn't sleepy yet and felt thirsty, so he went out and found a beer
hall, and ordered a draft and a plate of onion rings. He was thinking of striking up a
conversation with a young girl sitting nearby, but figured it wasn't the time or place to
make a pass. Tomorrow morning, after all, it was back to searching for the elusive stone.
He finished his beer, pulled on his Chunichi Dragons cap, left, and just wandered
around. Not the most appealing-looking city, he decided, but it felt pretty good to be
walking around wherever he wanted in a place he'd never been before. He always
enjoyed walking, anyway. A Marlboro between his lips, hands stuck in his pockets, he
wandered from one main street to another and down various alleys. When he wasn't
smoking he whistled. Some parts were lively and crowded, others deserted and deathly
quiet. No matter where he found himself, he kept up the same pace. He was young,
healthy, carefree, with nothing to fear.
He was walking down a narrow alley full of karaoke bars and clubs that looked
like they'd be operating under different names in six months, and had just come to a dark,
deserted spot when somebody called out behind him, "Hoshino! Hoshino!" in a loud
voice.
At first he couldn't believe it. Nobody knew him in Takamatsu--it had to be some
other Hoshino. It wasn't that common a name, but not that uncommon, either. He didn't
turn around and kept walking. But whoever it was followed him, calling out his name.
Hoshino finally stopped and turned around. Standing there was a short old man in
a white suit. White hair, a serious pair of glasses, a white mustache and goatee, white
shirt, and string tie. His face looked Japanese, but the whole outfit made him look more
like some country gentleman from the American South. He wasn't much over five feet
tall but looked less like a short person than a miniature, scaled-down version of a man.
He held both hands out in front of him like he was carrying a tray.
"Mr. Hoshino," the old man said, his voice clear and piercing, with a bit of an
accent.
Hoshino stared at the man in blank amazement.
"Right you are! I'm Colonel Sanders."
"You look just like him," Hoshino said, impressed.
"I don't just look like Colonel Sanders. It's who I am."
"The fried-chicken guy?"
The old man nodded heavily. "One and the same."
"Okay, but how do you know my name?"
"Chunichi Dragons fans I always call Hoshino. Nagashima's your basic Giants
name--likewise, for the Dragons it's got to be Hoshino, right?"
"Yeah, but Hoshino happens to be my real name."
"Pure coincidence," the old man boomed out. "Don't blame me."
"So what do you want?"
"Have I got a girl for you!"
"Oh, I get it," Hoshino said. "You're a pimp. That's why you're dolled up like
that."
"Mr. Hoshino, I don't know how many times I have to say this, but I'm not
dressed up as anybody. I am Colonel Sanders. Don't get mixed up here, all right?"
"Okay.... But if you're the real Colonel Sanders, what the heck are you doing
working as a pimp in a back alley in Takamatsu? You're famous, and must be raking in
the dough from license fees alone. You should be kicking back at a poolside somewhere
in the States, enjoying your retirement. So what's the story?"
"There's a kind of a warp at work in the world."
"A warp?"
"You probably don't know this, but that's how we have three dimensions. Because
of the warp. If you want everything to be nice and straight all the time, then go live in a
world made with a triangular ruler."
"You're pretty weird, you know that?" Hoshino said. "But hanging out with weird
old guys seems to be my fate these days. Any more of this and I won't know up from
down."
"That may be, Mr. Hoshino, but how about it? How about a nice girl?"
"You mean like one of those massage parlor places?"
"Massage parlor? What's that?"
"You know, those places where they won't let you do the dirty deed but can
manage a BJ or a hand job. Let you come that way, but no in-and-out."
"No, no," Colonel Sanders said, shaking his head in irritation. "That's not it at all.
My girls do it all--hand job, BJ, whatever you want, including the old in-and-out."
"Ah hah--so you're talking a soapland."
"What land?"
"Quit kidding around, okay? I've got somebody with me, and we've got an early
start in the morning. So I don't have time for any fooling around tonight."
"So you don't want a girl?"
"No girl. No fried chicken. I'm going back to get some sleep."
"But maybe you won't get to sleep that easily?" Colonel Sanders said knowingly.
"When a person's looking for something and can't find it, they usually can't sleep very
well."
Hoshino stood there, mouth agape, staring at him. "Looking for something?
How'd you know I'm looking for something?"
"It's written all over your face. By nature you're an honest person. Everything
you're thinking is written all over your face. It's like one side of a split-open dried
mackerel--everything inside your head's laid out for all to see."
Instinctively, Hoshino reached up and rubbed his cheek. He spread his hand open
and stared at it, but there was nothing there. Written all over my face?
"So," Colonel Sanders said, one finger held up for emphasis. "Is what you're
looking for by any chance round and hard?"
Hoshino frowned and said, "Come on, old man, who are you? How could you
know that?"
"I told you--it's written all over your face. You don't get it, do you?" Colonel
Sanders said, shaking his finger. "I haven't been in this business all these years for my
health, you know. So you really don't want a girl?"
"I'm looking for a kind of stone. It's called an entrance stone."
"I know all about it."
"You do?"
"I don't lie. Or tell jokes. I'm a straight-ahead, no-nonsense type of guy."
"Do you know where the stone is?"
"I know exactly where it is."
"So, could you--tell me where?"
Colonel Sanders touched his black-framed glasses and cleared his throat. "Are
you sure you don't want a girl?"
"If you'll tell me where the stone is, I'll think about it," Hoshino said dubiously.
"Great. Come with me." Without waiting for a reply, he walked briskly away
down the alley.
Hoshino scrambled to keep up. "Hey, old man. Colonel. I've only got about two
hundred bucks on me."
Colonel Sanders clicked his tongue as he trotted down the road. "That's plenty.
That'll get you a fresh-faced, nineteen-year-old beauty. She'll give you the full menu--BJ,
hand job, in-and-out, you name it. And afterward I'll throw this in for free--I'll tell you
all about the stone."
"Jeez Louise," Hoshino gasped.
Chapter 27
It's 2:47 when I notice the girl's here--a little earlier than last night. I glance at the clock
by my bed to remember the time. This time I stay up, waiting for her to appear. Other
than the occasional blink I don't close my eyes once. I thought I was paying attention,
but somehow I miss the actual moment she appears.
She has on her usual light blue dress and is sitting there the same as before, head
in hands, silently gazing at the painting of Kafka on the Shore. And I'm gazing at her
with bated breath. Painting, girl, and me--we form a still triangle in the room. She never
tires of looking at the picture, and likewise I never tire of gazing at her. The triangle is
fixed, unwavering. And then something totally unexpected happens.
"Miss Saeki," I hear myself say. I hadn't planned on speaking her name, but the
thought welled up in me and spilled out. In a very small voice, but she hears it. And one
side of the triangle collapses. Maybe I was secretly hoping it would--I don't know.
She looks in my direction, though not like she's straining to see. Her head's still in
her hands as she quietly turns her face. Like something--she's not sure what--has made
the air tremble ever so slightly.
I don't know if she can see me, but I want her to. I pray she notices me and knows
I exist. "Miss Saeki," I repeat. I can't keep myself from saying her name. Maybe she'll be
frightened by my voice and leave the room, never to return. I'd feel terrible if that
happened. No--not terrible, that's not what I mean. Devastated is more like it. If she
never came back everything would be lost to me forever. All meaning, all direction.
Everything. I know this, but I go ahead and risk it anyway, and call her name. Of their
own accord, almost automatically, my tongue and lips form her name, over and over.
She's not looking at the painting anymore, she's looking at me. Or at least I'm in
her field of vision. From where I sit I can't see her expression. Clouds move outside and
the moonlight flickers. It must be windy, but I can't hear it.
"Miss Saeki," I say again, carried away by some urgent, compelling,
overwhelming force.
She takes her head out of her hands, holds up her right hand in front of her as if to
tell me not to say anything more. But is that what she really wants to say? If only I could
go up to her and gaze into her eyes, to see what she's thinking right now, what emotions
are running through her. What is she trying to tell me? What is she hinting at? Damn, I
wish I knew. But this heavy, just-before-three-a. m. darkness has snatched away all
meaning. It's hard to breathe, and I close my eyes. There's a hard lump of air in my chest,
like I've swallowed a raincloud whole. When I open my eyes a few seconds later, she's
vanished. All that's left is an empty chair. A shadow of a cloud slides across the wall
above the desk.
I get out of bed, go over to the window, and look at the night sky. And think
about time that can never be regained. I think of rivers, of tides. Forests and water
gushing out. Rain and lightning. Rocks and shadows. All of these are in me.
The next day, in the afternoon, a detective stops by the library. I'm lying low in
my room and don't know he's there. The detective questions Oshima for about twenty
minutes and then leaves. Oshima comes to my room later to fill me in.
"A detective from a local precinct was asking about you," Oshima says, then
takes a bottle of Perrier from the fridge, uncaps it, pours the water into a glass, and takes
a drink.
"How did he know I was here?"
"You used a cell phone. Your dad's phone."
I check my memory and nod. That night I ended up all bloody in the woods
behind that shrine, I called Sakura on the cell phone. "I did, but just once."
"The police checked the calling record and traced you to Takamatsu. Usually
police don't get into details, but while we were chatting I got him to explain how they
traced the call. When I want to I can turn on the charm. He also let out that they couldn't
trace the person you called, so it must've been a prepaid phone. Anyhow, they know you
were in Takamatsu, and the local police have been checking all the hotels. They found
out that a boy named Kafka Tamura matching your description stayed in a business
hotel in town, through a special arrangment with the YMCA, until May 28th. The same
day somebody murdered your father."
At least the police didn't find out about Sakura. I'm thankful for that, having
bothered her enough already.
"The hotel manager remembered that you'd asked about our library. Remember
how he called to see if you were really coming here?"
I nod.
"That's why the police stopped by." Oshima takes a sip of Perrier. "Naturally I
lied. I told the detective I hadn't seen you since the 28th. That you'd been coming every
day, but not once since."
"You might get into trouble," I say.
"If I didn't lie, you'd be in a whole lot more trouble."
"But I don't want to get you involved."
Oshima narrows his eyes and smiles. "You don't get it, do you? You already have
gotten me involved."
"Yeah, I guess so--"
"Let's not argue, okay? What's done is done. Talking about it now won't get us
anywhere."
I nod, not saying a word.
"Anyway, the detective left his card and told me to call him right away if you
ever showed up again."
"Am I a suspect?"
Oshima slowly shakes his head. "I doubt it. But they do think you might be able
to help them out. I've been following all this in the newspaper. The investigation isn't
getting anywhere, and the police are getting impatient. No fingerprints, no clues, no
witnesses. You're the only lead they have. Which explains why they're trying so hard to
track you down. Your dad's famous, too, so the murder's been covered in detail on TV
and in magazines. The police aren't about to sit around and twiddle their thumbs."
"But if they find out you lied to them, they won't accept you as a witness
anymore--and there goes my alibi. They might think I did it."
Oshima shook his head again. "Japanese police aren't that stupid, Kafka. Lacking
in imagination, yes, but they're not incompetent. I'm sure they've already checked all the
passenger lists for planes from Tokyo to Shikoku. I don't know if you're aware of this,
but they have video cameras set up at all the gates at airports, to photograph all the
boarding passengers. By now they know you didn't fly back to Tokyo around the time of
the incident. Information in Japan is micromanaged, believe me. So the police don't
consider you a suspect. If they did, they wouldn't send some local cop, but detectives
from the National Police Agency. If that happened they would've grilled me pretty hard
and there's no way I could've outsmarted them. They just want to hear from you
whatever information you can provide about the incident."
It makes perfect sense, what he says.
"Anyhow, you'd better keep a low profile for a while," he says. "The police might
be staking out the area, keeping an eye out for you. They had photos of you with them.
Copies of your official junior high class picture. Can't say it looked much like you,
though. You looked really mad in the photo."
That was the only photograph I left behind. I always tried to avoid having my
picture taken, but not having this one taken wasn't an option.
"The police said you were a troublemaker at school. There were some violent
incidents involving you and your classmates. And you were suspended three times."
"Twice, not three times. And I wasn't suspended, just officially grounded," I
explain. I breathe in deeply, then slowly breathe out. "I have times like that, yeah."
"You can't control yourself," Oshima says.
I nod.
"And you hurt other people?"
"I don't mean to. But it's like there's somebody else living inside me. And when I
come to, I find out I've hurt somebody."
"Hurt them how much?" Oshima asks.
I sigh. "Nothing major. No broken bones or missing teeth or anything."
Oshima sits down on the bed, crosses his legs, and brushes his hair off his
forehead. He's wearing navy blue chinos, a black polo shirt, and white Adidas. "Seems
to me you have a lot of issues you've got to deal with."
A lot of issues. I look up. "Don't you have any?"
Oshima holds his hands in the air. "Not all that many. But there is one thing. For
me, inside this physical body--this defective container--the most important job is
surviving from one day to the next. It could be simple, or very hard. It all depends on
how you look at it. Either way, even if things go well, that's not some great achievement.
Nobody's going to give me a standing ovation or anything."
I bite my lip for a while, then ask, "Don't you ever think about getting out of that
container?"
"You mean leaving my physical body?"
I nod.
"Symbolically? Or for real?"
"Either one."
Oshima flips his hair back with a hand. I can picture the gears going full speed
just below the surface of his pale forehead. "Are you thinking you'd like to do that?"
I take a breath. "Oshima, to tell you the unvarnished truth, I don't like the
container I'm stuck in. Never have. I hate it, in fact. My face, my hands, my blood, my
genes... I hate everything I inherited from my parents. I'd like nothing better than to
escape it all, like running away from home."
He gazes into my face and smiles. "You have a nice, muscular body. No matter
who you inherited it from, you're quite handsome. Well, maybe a little too unique to be
called handsome, exactly. But you're not bad looking. At least I like the way you look.
You're smart, you're quick. You've got a nice cock, too. I envy you that. You're going to
have tons of girls fall for you, guaranteed. So I can't see what you're dissatisfied with
about your container."
I blush.
"Okay, I guess that's all beside the point," Oshima continues. "I'm not crazy about
the container I'm in, that's for sure. How could I be--this crummy piece of work? It's
pretty inconvenient, I can tell you. Still, inside here, this is what I think: If we reverse
the outer shell and the essence--in other words, consider the outer shell the essence and
the essence only the shell--our lives might be a whole lot easier to understand."
I stare at my hands, thinking about all that blood on them, how sticky they felt. I
think about my own essence, my own shell. The essence of me, surrounded by the shell
that's me. But these thoughts are driven away by one indelible image: all that blood.
"How about Miss Saeki?" I ask.
"What do you mean?"
"You think she has issues to overcome?"
"You'd better ask her yourself," Oshima says.
At two I take a cup of coffee on a tray up to Miss Saeki's room, where she's
sitting at her desk. Like always there's writing paper and a fountain pen on the desk, but
the pen is still capped. Both hands resting on the desk, she's staring off into space. Not
like she's looking at anything, just gazing at a place that isn't there. She seems tired. The
window behind her is open, the early summer breeze rustling the white lace curtain. The
scene looks like some beautiful allegorical painting.
"Thank you," she says when I put the coffee cup on her desk.
"You look a little tired."
She nods. "I imagine I look a lot older when I get tired."
"Not at all. You look wonderful, like always."
She smiles. "For someone so young, you certainly know how to flatter a woman."
My face reddens.
Miss Saeki points to a chair. The same chair as yesterday, in exactly the same
position. I take a seat.
"I'm used to being tired, but I don't imagine you are."
"I guess not."
"When I was fifteen I wasn't either, of course." She picks up the coffee cup and
takes a sip. "Kafka, what can you see outside?"
I look out the window behind her. "I see trees, the sky, and some clouds. Some
birds on tree branches."
"Nothing out of the ordinary. Right?"
"That's right."
"But if you knew you might not be able to see it again tomorrow, everything
would suddenly become special and precious, wouldn't it?"
"I suppose so."
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"I have."
A surprised look comes over her. "When?"
"When I'm in love," I tell her.
She smiles faintly, and it continues to hover around her lips. This puts me in mind
of how refreshing water looks after someone's sprinkled it in a tiny hollow outside on a
summer day.
"Are you in love?" she asks.
"Yes."
"And her face and whole being are special and precious to you, each time you see
her?"
"That's right. And I might lose those."
Miss Saeki looks at me for a while, and the smile fades away. "Picture a bird
perched on a thin branch," she says. "The branch sways in the wind, and each time this
happens the bird's field of vision shifts. You know what I mean?"
I nod.
"When that happens, how do you think the bird adjusts?"
I shake my head. "I don't know."
"It bobs its head up and down, making up for the sway of the branch. Take a good
look at birds the next time it's windy. I spend a lot of time looking out that window.
Don't you think that kind of life would be tiring? Always shifting your head every time
the branch you're on sways?"
"I do."
"Birds are used to it. It comes naturally to them. They don't have to think about it,
they just do it. So it's not as tiring as we imagine. But I'm a human being, not a bird, so
sometimes it does get tiring."
"You're on a branch somewhere?"
"In a manner of speaking," she says. "And sometimes the wind blows pretty
hard." She places the cup back on the saucer and takes the cap off her fountain pen.
This is my signal, so I stand up. "Miss Saeki, there's something I've got to ask
you."
"Something personal?"
"Yes. And maybe out of line, too."
"But it's important?"
"For me it is."
She puts the pen back on the desk, and her eyes fill with a kind of neutral glow.
"All right. Go ahead."
"Do you have any chidlren?"
She takes in a breath and pauses. The expression on her face slowly retreats
somewhere far away, then comes back. Kind of like a parade that disappears down a
street, then marches back up the same street toward you again.
"Why do you want to know that?"
"It's personal. It's not just some spur-of-the-moment question."
She lifts up her Mont Blanc like she's testing the thickness and heft of it, then sets
it on the desk and looks up. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you a yes or no answer. At least
right now. I'm tired, and there's a strong wind blowing."
I nod. "Sorry. I shouldn't have asked."
"It's all right. I'm not blaming you," she says gently. "Thank you for the coffee.
You make excellent coffee."
I leave and go back down the stairs to my room. I sit on my bed and try to read,
but nothing seems to filter into my head. I feel like I'm gazing at some table of random
numbers, just following the words with my eyes. I put my book down, go over to the
window, and look at the garden. There are birds on some of the branches, but no wind to
speak of. Am I in love with Miss Saeki when she was fifteen? Or with the real, fiftysomething
Miss Saeki upstairs? I don't know anymore. The boundary line separating the
two has started to waver, to fade, and I can't focus. And that confuses me. I close my
eyes and try to find some center inside to hold on to.
But you know, she's right. Every single day, each time I see her face, see her, it's
utterly precious.
Chapter 28
For a man his age Colonel Sanders was light on his feet, and so fast that he resembled a
veteran speed walker. And he seemed to know every nook and cranny of the city. He
took short cuts up dark, narrow staircases, turning sideways to squeeze through the
narrow passages between houses. He leaped over a ditch, hushing a barking dog behind
a hedge with a short command. Like some restless spirit searching for its home, his
small white-suited figure raced through the back alleys of the town. It was all Hoshino
could do to keep up. He was soon out of breath, his armpits soaked. Colonel Sanders
never once looked back to see if he was following.
"Hey, are we almost there?" Hoshino finally called out impatiently.
"What are you talking about, young fellow? I wouldn't even call this a walk,"
Colonel Sanders replied, still not turning around.
"Yeah, but I'm a customer, remember? What's going to happen to my sex drive if
I'm all pooped out?"
"What a disgrace! And you call yourself a man? If a little walk's going to kill
your desire, you might as well not have any from the beginning."
"Jeez," Hoshino muttered.
Colonel Sanders cut across another side street, crossed a main road, oblivious to
the traffic light, and continued walking. He strode over a bridge and ducked into a shrine.
A fairly big shrine, by the looks of it, but it was late and no one else was around.
Colonel Sanders pointed to a bench in front of the shrine office, indicating that Hoshino
should take a seat. A mercury lamp was next to the bench, and everything was as bright
as day. Hoshino did as he was told, and Colonel Sanders sat down next to him.
"You're not going to make me do it here, are you?" Hoshino asked worriedly.
"Don't be an idiot. We're not like those deer that hang around the famous shrines
and go at it. I'm not about to have you do it in a shrine. Who do you think I am,
anyway?" Then he extracted a silver cell phone from his pocket and punched in a threedigit
number. "Yeah, it's me," he said when the other person answered. "The usual place.
The shrine. I've got a young man named Hoshino here with me. That's right... the same
as usual. Yes, I got it. Just get here as soon as you can." He switched off the phone and
slipped it back into the pocket of his white suit.
"Do you always call up the girls from this shrine?" Hoshino asked.
"Anything wrong with that?"
"No, not really. I was just thinking there's got to be a better place. Someplace
more... normal? A coffee shop, or maybe have me wait in a hotel room?"
"A shrine's quiet. And the air's crisp and clean."
"True, but waiting for a girl on a bench in front of a shrine office--it's hard to
relax. I feel like I'm going to fall under the spell of one of those fox spirits or
something."
"What are you talking about? You're not making fun of Shikoku now, are you?
Takamatsu's a proper city--the prefectural capital, in fact. Not some hick town. We don't
have any foxes here."
"Okay, okay, just kidding.... But you're in the service industry, so I was just
thinking you'd better worry more about creating an atmosphere, you know what I'm
saying? Something luxurious, to get you in the mood. I don't know, maybe it's none of
my business."
"You're right. It isn't," Colonel Sanders intoned. "Now about that stone..."
"Right! The stone... Tell me about it."
"After you do the deed. Then we talk."
"Doing the deed's important, huh?"
Colonel Sanders nodded gravely a couple of times, and tugged at his goatee.
"That's right. It's a formality you have to go through. Then we'll talk about the stone. I
know you're going to like this girl. She's our top girl. Luscious breasts, skin like silk. A
nice, curvy waist, hot and wet right where you like it, a regular sex machine. To use a
car metaphor, she's four-wheel drive in bed, turbocharged desire, step on the gas, the
surging gearshift in her hands, you round the corner, she shifts gears ecstatically, you
race out in the passing lane, and bang! You're there--Hoshino's dead and gone to
heaven."
"You're quite a character, you know that?" Hoshino said admiringly.
"Like I said, I'm not in this business for my health."
Fifteen minutes later the girl arrived, and Colonel Sanders was right--she was a
knockout. Tight miniskirt, black high heels, a small black-enamel shoulder bag. She
could easily have been a model. Generous breasts, too, spilling out of her low-cut top.
"Will she do?" Colonel Sanders asked.
Hoshino was too stunned to reply, and just nodded.
"A veritable sex machine, Hoshino. Have yourself a ball," Colonel Sanders said,
smiling for the first time. He gave Hoshino a pinch on the rump.
The girl took Hoshino to a nearby love hotel, where she filled up the bathtub,
quickly slipped out of her clothes, and then undressed him. She washed him carefully all
over, then commenced to lick him, sliding into a totally artistic act of fellatio, doing
things to him he'd never seen or heard of in his life. He couldn't think of anything else
but coming, and come he did.
"Man alive, that was fantastic. I've never felt like that," Hoshino said, languidly
sinking back in the hot tub.
"That's just the beginning," the girl said. "Wait till you see what's next."
"Yeah, but man that was good."
"How good?"
"Like there's no past or future anymore."
"The pure present is an ungraspable advance of the past devouring the future. In
truth, all sensation is already memory."
Hoshino looked up, mouth half open, and gazed at her face. "What's that?"
"Henri Bergson," she replied, licking the semen from the tip of his penis. "Mame
mo memelay."
"I'm sorry?"
"Matter and Memory. You ever read it?"
"I don't think so," Hoshino replied after a moment's thought. Except for the
special SDF driver's manual he was forced to study--and the books on Shikoku history
he'd just gone through at the library--he couldn't remember reading anything except
manga.
"Have you read it?"
The girl nodded. "I had to. I'm majoring in philosophy in college, and we have
exams coming up."
"You don't say," Hoshino said. "So this is a part-time job?"
"To help pay tuition."
She took him over to the bed, stroked him all over with her fingertips and tongue,
getting another erection out of him. A firm hard-on, a Tower of Pisa at carnival time.
"See, you're ready to go again," the girl remarked, slowly segueing into her next
set of motions. "Any special requests? Something you'd like me to do? Mr. Sanders
asked me to make sure you got everything you want."
"I can't think of anything special, but could you quote some more of that
philosophy stuff? I don't know why, but it might keep me from coming so quick.
Otherwise I'll lose it pretty fast."
"Let's see.... This is pretty old, but how about some Hegel?"
"Whatever."
"I recommend Hegel. He's sort of out of date, but definitely an oldie but goodie."
"Sounds good to me."
"At the same time that 'I' am the content of a relation, 'I' am also that which does
the relating."
"Hmm..."
"Hegel believed that a person is not merely conscious of self and object as
separate entities, but through the projection of the self via the mediation of the object is
volitionally able to gain a deeper understanding of the self. All of which constitutes selfconsciousness."
"I don't know what the heck you're talking about."
"Well, think of what I'm doing to you right now. For me I'm the self, and you're
the object. For you, of course, it's the exact opposite--you're the self to you and I'm the
object. And by exchanging self and object, we can project ourselves onto the other and
gain self-consciousness. Volitionally."
"I still don't get it, but it sure feels good."
"That's the whole idea," the girl said.
Afterward he said good-bye to the girl and returned to the shrine, where Colonel
Sanders was sitting on the bench just as he'd left him.
"You been waiting here the whole time?" Hoshino asked.
Colonel Sanders shook his head irritably. "Don't be a moron. Do I really look like
I have that much time on my hands? While you were sailing off to heaven, I was
working the back alleys again. She called me when you finished, and I rushed over. So,
how was our little sex machine? Pretty good, I'll bet."
"She was great. No complaints by me. I got off three times. Volitionally speaking.
I must've lost five pounds."
"Glad to hear it. Now, about the stone..."
"Right, that's what I came here for."
"Actually, the stone's in the woods right here in this shrine."
"We're talking about the entrance stone?"
"That's right. The entrance stone."
"Are you sure you're not just making this up?"
Colonel Sanders's head shot up. "What are you talking about, you dingbat? Have I
ever lied to you? Do I just make up things? I told you I'd get you a supple young sex
machine, and I kept my end of the bargain. At a bargain-basement price, too--only $120,
and you were brazen enough to shoot off three times, no less. All that and you still doubt
me?"
"Don't blow a fuse! Of course I believe you. It's just that when things are going
along a little too smoothly, I get a bit suspicious, that's all. I mean, think about it--I'm
walking along and a guy in a funny getup calls out to me, tells me he knows where to
find the stone, then I go with him and get off with this drop-dead-gorgeous babe."
"Three times, you mean."
"Whatever. So I get off three times, and then you tell me the stone I'm looking for
is right over there? That would confuse anybody."
"You still don't get it, do you? We're talking about a revelation here," Colonel
Sanders said, clicking his tongue. "A revelation leaps over the borders of the everyday.
A life without revelation is no life at all. What you need to do is move from reason that
observes to reason that acts. That's what's critical. Do you have any idea what I'm
talking about, you gold-plated whale of a dunce?"
"The projection and exchange between self and object...?" Hoshino timidly began.
"Good. I'm glad you know that much at least. That's the point. Follow me, and
you can pay your respects to your precious stone. A special package deal, just for you."
Chapter 29
I call up Sakura from the public phone in the library. I realize I haven't been in touch
once since that night at her place--just a short note and that was it. I'm kind of
embarrassed about the way I said good-bye. After I left her apartment I went right to the
library, Oshima drove me up to the cabin for a few days, well out of range of any phone.
Then I came to live and work at the library, encountering Miss Saeki's living spirit--or
something like it--every night. And I've fallen head over heels for that fifteen-year-old
girl. A ton of things happened, one after another--enough to keep anybody busy. Not
that that's any excuse.
It's around nine p. m. when I call, and she answers after six rings.
"Where in the world have you been?" Sakura asks in a hard voice.
"I'm still in Takamatsu."
She doesn't say anything for a while. In the background I hear a music program
on TV.
"Somehow I've survived," I add.
Silence, then a kind of resigned sigh.
"What did you mean by disappearing like that? I was worried about you, so I
came home a little early that day. Even did some shopping for us."
"I know it was wrong. I do. But I had to leave. My mind was all messed up and I
had to get away to think things out, try to get back on my feet. Being with you was--I
don't know--I can't put it into words."
"Overstimulating?"
"Yeah. I've never been near a girl like that before."
"No kidding?"
"You know, the scent of a girl. All kinds of things..."
"Pretty rough being young, huh?"
"I guess," I say. "So how's your job going?"
"It's been a madhouse. But I wanted to work and save up some money, so I
shouldn't complain."
I pause, then tell her about the police looking for me.
She's silent for a while, then cautiously says, "All that business with the blood?"
I decide to hold back on telling the truth. "No, that's not it. Nothing about the
blood. They're after me because I'm a runaway. They want to catch me and ship me back
to Tokyo, that's all. So the cops might get in touch with you. The other day, the night I
stayed over, I called your cell phone using mine, and they traced the phone records and
found I was here in Takamatsu."
"Don't worry," she says. "It's a prepaid phone, so there's no way they can trace the
owner."
"That's a relief," I say. "I didn't want to cause you any more trouble than I already
have."
"You're so sweet you're going to make me cry, you know that?"
"No, that's how I really feel."
"I know," she says like she'd rather not admit it. "So where's our little runaway
staying these days?"
"Somebody I know is letting me stay over."
"Since when do you know anybody here?"
How could I possibly summarize everything that's happened to me in the past few
days? "It's a long story," I say.
"With you it's always long stories."
"I don't why, but it always turns out that way."
"Sort of a tendency of yours?"
"I guess so," I reply. "I'll tell you all about it someday when I have the time. It's
not like I'm hiding anything. I just can't explain it well over the phone."
"That's okay. I just hope you're not into anything you shouldn't be."
"No, nothing like that. I'm okay, don't worry."
She sighs again. "I can understand wanting to be out on your own, but just don't
get mixed up with anything illegal, okay? It isn't worth it. I don't want to see you die
some miserable teenage death like Billy the Kid."
"Billy the Kid didn't die in his teens," I correct her. "He killed twenty-one people
and died when he was twenty-one."
"If you say so.... Anyway, was there something you wanted?"
"I just wanted to thank you. I feel bad about leaving like that after you were so
nice."
"Thanks, but why don't we just forget that, okay?"
"I wanted to hear your voice, too," I say.
"I'm happy to hear that, but how does that help anything?"
"I don't know how to put it exactly.... This might sound strange, but you're living
in the real world, breathing real air, speaking real words. Talking with you makes me
feel, for the time being, connected to reality. And that's really important to me now."
"The people you're with now aren't?"
"I'm not sure," I tell her.
"So what you're saying is you're in some unreal place, with people cut off from
reality?"
I think about that for a while. "You might say that."
"Kafka," Sakura says. "I know it's your life and I shouldn't butt in, but I think
you'd better get out of there. I don't know what kind of place you're in, but I get the
feeling that's the smart move. Call it a hunch. Why don't you come over to my place?
You can stay as long as you like."
"Why are you so nice to me?"
"What are you, a dunce?"
"What do you mean?"
"'Cause I like you--can't you figure that out? I'm a basically curious type, but I
wouldn't do this for just anybody. I've done all this for you because I like you, okay? I
don't know how to put it, but you feel like a younger brother to me."
I hold the phone without saying a word. For a second I'm completely confused,
even dizzy. Nobody's ever said anything like that to me. Ever.
"You still there?" Sakura asks.
"Yeah," I manage to say.
"Well, then say something."
I stand up straight and take a deep breath. "Sakura, I wish I could do that. I really
do. But I can't right now. Like I told you, I can't leave here. I'm in love."
"With some complicated, unreal person?"
"You could say that."
I hear her sigh again--a deep, profound kind of sigh. "You know, when kids your
age fall in love they tend to get a little spacey, so if the person you're in love with isn't
connected to reality, that's a major problem. You follow me?"
"Yeah, I get it."
"Kafka?"
"Hmm?"
"If anything happens, call me, okay? Don't hesitate, at all."
"I appreciate it."
I hang up, go back to my room, put the single of "Kafka on the Shore" on the
turntable, and lower the needle. And once more, whether I like it or not, I'm swept away
to that place. To that time.
I sense a presence and open my eyes. It's totally dark. The fluorescent numbers on
the alarm clock next to my bed show it's after three. I must've fallen asleep. In the faint
light from the lamppost out in the garden I see her sitting there. As always she's at the
desk, gazing at the painting on the wall. Motionless, head in her hands. And I'm lying in
bed as before, trying hard not to breathe, eyes barely open, gazing at her silhouette.
Outside the window the breeze from the sea is rustling the branches of the dogwood.
After a while, though, I sense that something's different. Something in the air that
disturbs the perfect harmony of our little world. I strain to see through the gloom. What
is it? The wind momentarily picks up, and the blood coursing through my veins begins
to feel strangely thick and heavy. The dogwood branches draw a nervous maze on the
windowpane. Finally it comes to me. The silhouette isn't that of the young girl. It looks a
lot like her, almost an exact match. But it isn't exactly the same. Like a copy of a
drawing laid over the real thing, some of the details are off. Her hairstyle is different, for
one thing. And she has on different clothes. Her whole presence is different.
Unconsciously I shake my head. It isn't the girl sitting there--it's someone else.
Something's happening, something very important. I'm clutching my hands tightly
beneath the covers, and my heart, unable to stand it anymore, starts pounding hard,
beating out an unexpected, erratic rhythm.
As if that sound is the signal, the silhouette in the chair starts to move, slowly
changing its angle like some massive ship changing course. She takes her head out of
her hands and turns in my direction. With a start I realize it's Miss Saeki. I gulp and can't
let my breath out. It's the Miss Saeki of the present. The real Miss Saeki. She looks at
me for a while, quietly concentrating like when she's looking at the painting, and a
thought hits me--the axis of time. Somewhere I don't know about, something weird is
happening to time. Reality and dreams are all mixed up, like seawater and river water
flowing together. I struggle to find the meaning behind it all, but nothing makes any
sense.
Finally she gets to her feet and slowly comes toward me, holding herself as erect
as always. She's barefoot, and the floorboards faintly creak as she walks. Silently she
sits down on the edge of the bed, and remains still for a time. Her body has a definite
density and weight. She has on a white silk blouse and a navy blue skirt that reaches to
her knees. She reaches out and touches my head, her fingers groping through my short
hair. Her hand is real, with real fingers touching me. She stands up again, and in the
faint light shining in from outside--like it's the most natural thing to do--begins to
undress. She's in no hurry, but she doesn't hesitate, either. In smooth, natural motions
she unbuttons her blouse, slips out of her skirt, and steps out of her panties. Piece by
piece her clothing falls to the floor, the soft fabric hardly making a sound. She's asleep, I
realize. Her eyes are open but it's like she's sleepwalking.
Once she's naked she crawls into the narrow bed and wraps her pale arms around
me. Her warm breath grazes my neck, her pubic hair pushing up against my thigh. She
must think I'm her dead boyfriend from long ago, and that she's doing what they used to
do here in this very room. Fast asleep, dreaming, she goes through the motions from
long ago.
I figure I'd better wake her up. She's making a big mistake, and I have to let her
know. This isn't a dream--it's real life. But everything's happening so fast, and I don't
have the strength to resist. Thrown totally off balance, I feel like I'm being sucked into a
time warp.
And you're sucked into a time warp.
Before you know it, her dream has wrapped itself around your mind. Gently,
warmly, like amniotic fluid. Miss Saeki will take off your T-shirt, pull off your boxers.
She'll kiss your neck over and over, then reach out and hold your penis, which is already
porcelain-hard. Gently she wraps her hand around your balls, and wordlessly guides
your fingers to her pubic hair. Her vagina is warm and wet. She kisses your chest,
sucking your nipples. Your fingers are slowly sucked inside her.
Where does your responsibility begin here? Wiping away the nebula from your
sight, you struggle to find where you really are. You're trying to find the direction of the
flow, struggling to hold on to the axis of time. But you can't locate the borderline
separating dream and reality. Or even the boundary between what's real and what's
possible. All you're sure of is that you're in a delicate position. Delicate--and dangerous.
You're pulled along, a part of it, unable to pin down the principles of prophecy, or of
logic. Like when a river overflows, washing over a town, all road signs have sunk
beneath the waves. And all you can see are the anonymous roofs of the sunken houses.
You're faceup, and Miss Saeki gets on top of you. She guides your rock-hard cock
inside her. You're helpless--she's the one who's in charge. She bends and twists her waist
as if tracing a picture with her body. Her straight hair falls on your shoulders and
trembles noiselessly, like the branches of a willow. Little by little you're sucked down
into the warm mud. The whole world turns warm, wet, indistinct, and all that exists is
your rigid, glistening cock. You close your eyes and your own dream begins. It's hard to
tell how much time is passing. The tide comes in, the moon rises. And soon you come.
There's nothing you can do to stop it. You come over and over inside her. The warm
walls inside her contract, gathering in your semen. All this while she's still asleep with
her eyes wide open. She's in a different world, and that's where your seed goes--
swallowed down into a place apart.
A long time passes. I can't move. Every part of me is paralyzed. Paralyzed, or else
maybe I just don't feel like trying to move. She gets off and lies down beside me. After a
while she gets up, tugs on her panties, pulls on her skirt, and buttons up her blouse. She
gently reaches out again and tousles my hair. All this takes place without a word passing
between us. She hasn't said a thing since she entered the room. The only sounds are the
creak of the floorboards, the wind blowing ceaselessly outside. The room breathing out,
the windowpane shivering. That's the chorus behind me.
Still asleep, she crosses the room and leaves. The door's open just a crack but she
slips right out like a delicate, dreamy fish. Silently the door closes. I watch from the bed
as she makes her exit, still unable to move. I can't even raise a finger. My lips are tightly
sealed. Words are asleep in a corner of time.
Unable to move a muscle, I lie there straining to hear. I imagine I'll catch the roar
of her Golf in the parking lot. But I never hear it, no matter how long I listen. The wind
blows clouds over, then scatters them away. The branches of the dogwood quiver, and
countless knives flash in the darkness. The window is my heart's window, the door my
soul's door. I lie there awake until dawn, gazing at the empty chair.
Chapter 30
The two of them scrambled over the low hedge into the woods. Colonel Sanders took a
small flashlight out of his pocket and illuminated the narrow path. The woods weren't
very deep, but the trees were hugely ancient, the tangle of their branches looming darkly
above. A strong grassy odor came from the ground below.
Colonel Sanders took the lead, for once maintaining a leisurely pace. Shining the
flashlight to make sure of his footing, he cautiously took one step at a time.
Hoshino followed right behind. "Hey, Unc, is this some kind of dare or
something?" he said to the Colonel's white back. "Whoa--a ghost!"
"Why don't you zip it for a change," Colonel Sanders said without turning around.
"Okay, okay." Hoshino suddenly wondered how Nakata was doing. Probably still
sound asleep. It's like the term sound asleep was invented just to describe him--once he
falls asleep, that's all she wrote. What kind of dreams does he have, though, during those
record-breaking sleeps? Hoshino couldn't imagine. "Are we there yet?"
"Almost," Colonel Sanders replied.
"Tell me something," Hoshino began.
"What?"
"Are you really Colonel Sanders?"
Colonel Sanders cleared his throat. "Not really. I'm just taking on his appearance
for a time."
"That's what I figured," Hoshino said. "So what are you really?"
"I don't have a name."
"How do you get along without one?"
"No problem. Originally I don't have a name or a shape."
"So you're kind of like a fart."
"You could say that. Since I don't have a shape I can become anything I want."
"Huh..."
"This time I decided to take on a familiar shape, that of a famous capitalist icon. I
was toying with the idea of Mickey Mouse, but Disney's particular about the rights to
their characters."
"I don't think I'd want Mickey Mouse pimping for me anyway."
"I see your point."
"Dressing up like Colonel Sanders fits your character, too."
"But I don't have a character. Or any feelings. Shape I may take, converse I may,
but neither god nor Buddha am I, rather an insensate being whose heart thus differs from
that of man."
"What the--?"
"A line from Ueda Akinari's Tales of Moonlight and Rain. I doubt you've read it."
"You got me there."
"I'm appearing here in human form, but I'm neither god nor Buddha. My heart
works differently from humans' hearts because I don't have any feelings. That's what it
means."
"Hmm," Hoshino said. "I'm not sure I follow, but what you're saying is you're not
a person and not a god or Buddha either, right?"
"Neither god nor Buddha, just the insensate. As such, of the good and bad of man
I neither inquire nor follow."
"Meaning?"
"Since I'm neither god nor Buddha, I don't need to judge whether people are good
or evil. Likewise I don't have to act according to standards of good and evil."
"In other words you exist beyond good and evil."
"You're too kind. I'm not beyond good and evil, exactly--they just don't matter to
me. I have no idea what's good or what's evil. I'm a very pragmatic being. A neutral
object, as it were, and all I care about is consummating the function I've been given to
perform."
"Consummate your function? What's that?"
"Didn't you go to school?"
"Yeah, I went to high school, but it was a trade school. I spent all my time
screwing around on motorcyles."
"I'm kind of an overseer, supervising something to make sure it fulfills its original
role. Checking the correlation between different worlds, making sure things are in the
right order. So results follow causes and meanings don't get all mixed up. So the past
comes before the present, the future after it. Things can get a little out of order, that's
okay. Nothing's perfect. If the account book's basically in balance, though, that's fine by
me. To tell you the truth, I'm not much of a detail person. The technical term for it is
'Abbreviating Sensory Processing of Continuous Information,' but I don't want to get
into all that. It'd take too long to explain, and I know it's beyond you. So let's cut to the
chase. What I'm getting at is I'm not going to complain about each and every little thing.
Of course if the accounts don't eventually balance, that is a problem. I do have my
responsibility to consider."
"I got a question for you. If you're such an important person, how come you're a
pimp in a back alley in Takamatsu?"
"I am not a person, okay? How many times do I have to tell you?"
"Whatever..."
"Pimping's just a means of getting you here. There's something I need you to lend
me a hand with, so as a reward I thought I'd let you have a good time first. A kind of
formality we have to go through."
"Lend you a hand?"
"As I've explained, I don't have any form. I'm a metaphysical, conceptual object. I
can take on any form, but I lack substance. And to perform a real act, I need someone
with substance to help out."
"And at this particular point that substance happens to be me."
"Exactly," Colonel Sanders replied.
They cautiously continued down the path, and came to a smaller shrine beneath a
thick oak tree. The shrine was old and dilapidated, with no offerings or decorations of
any kind.
Colonel Sanders shined his flashlight on it. "The stone's inside there. Open the
door."
"No way!" Hoshino replied. "You're not supposed to open up shrines whenever
you feel like it. You'll be cursed. Your nose will fall off. Or your ears or something."
"Not to worry. I said it's all right, so go ahead and open it. You won't be cursed.
Your nose and ears won't fall off. God, you can be really old-fashioned."
"Then why don't you open it? I don't want to get mixed up in that."
"How many times do I have to explain this?! I told you already I don't have
substance. I'm an abstract concept. I can't do anything on my own. That's why I went to
the trouble of dragging you out here. And letting you do it three times at a discount
rate."
"Yeah, man, she was fantastic... but robbing a shrine? No way! My grandfather
always told me not to mess with shrines. He was really strict about it."
"Forget about your grandfather. Don't lay all your Gifu Prefecture, countrybumpkin
morality on me, okay? We don't have time for that."
Grumbling all the while, Hoshino hesitantly opened the door of the shrine, and
Colonel Sanders shined his flashlight inside. Sure enough, there was an old round stone
inside. Just like Nakata said, it was about the size of a big rice cake, a smooth white
stone.
"This is it?" Hoshino asked.
"That's right," Colonel Sanders said. "Take it out."
"Hold on a minute. That's stealing."
"No matter. Nobody's going to notice if a stone like this is missing. And nobody'll
care."
"Yeah, but the stone is owned by God, right? He's gonna be pissed if we take it
out."
Colonel Sanders folded his arms and stared straight at Hoshino. "What is God?"
The question threw Hoshino for a moment.
Colonel Sanders pressed him further. "What does God look like, and what does
He do?"
"Don't ask me. God's God. He's everywhere, watching what we do, judging
whether it's good or bad."
"Sounds like a soccer referee."
"Sort of, I guess."
"So God wears shorts, has a whistle sticking out of His mouth, and keeps an eye
on the clock?"
"You know that's not what I mean," Hoshino said.
"Are the Japanese God and the foreign God relatives, or maybe enemies?"
"How should I know?"
"Listen--God only exists in people's minds. Especially in Japan, God's always
been kind of a flexible concept. Look at what happened after the war. Douglas
MacArthur ordered the divine emperor to quit being God, and he did, making a speech
saying he was just an ordinary person. So after 1946 he wasn't God anymore. That's
what Japanese gods are like--they can be tweaked and adjusted. Some American
chomping on a cheap pipe gives the order and presto change-o--God's no longer God. A
very postmodern kind of thing. If you think God's there, He is. If you don't, He isn't.
And if that's what God's like, I wouldn't worry about it."
"Okay..."
"Anyway, just get the stone out, would you? I'll take full responsibility. I might
not be a god or a Buddha, but I do have a few connections. I'll make sure you aren't
cursed."
"You sure?"
"I won't go back on my word."
Hoshino reached out and carefully, like he was inching out a landmine, picked up
the stone. "It's pretty heavy."
"This isn't tofu we're dealing with. Stones tend to be heavy."
"But even for a stone it's heavy," Hoshino said. "So what do you want me to do
with it?"
"Take it home and put it next to your bed. After that things will take their course."
"You want me to take it back to the inn?"
"You can take a cab if it's too heavy," Colonel Sanders replied.
"Yeah, but is it okay to take it so far away?"
"Listen, every object's in flux. The Earth, time, concepts, love, life, faith, justice,
evil--they're all fluid and in transition. They don't stay in one form or in one place
forever. The whole universe is like some big FedEx box."
"Hm."
"This stone's temporarily there in the form of a stone. Moving it isn't going to
change anything."
"All right, but what's so special about this stone? It doesn't look like much of
anything."
"The stone itself is meaningless. The situation calls for something, and at this
point in time it just happens to be this stone. Anton Chekhov put it best when he said, 'If
a pistol appears in a story, eventually it's got to be fired.' Do you know what he means?"
"Nope."
Colonel Sanders sighed. "I didn't think so, but I had to ask. It's the polite thing to
do."
"Much obliged."
"What Chekhov was getting at is this: necessity is an independent concept. It has
a different structure from logic, morals, or meaning. Its function lies entirely in the role
it plays. What doesn't play a role shouldn't exist. What necessity requires does need to
exist. That's what you call dramaturgy. Logic, morals, or meaning don't have anything to
do with it. It's all a question of relationality. Chekhov understood dramaturgy very
well."
"Whoa--you're way over my head."
"The stone you're carrying there is Chekhov's pistol. It will have to be fired. So in
that sense it's important. But there's nothing sacred or holy about it. So don't worry
yourself about any curse."
Hoshino frowned. "This stone's a pistol?"
"Only in the metaphorical sense. Don't worry--bullets aren't about to shoot out."
Colonel Sanders took a huge furoshiki cloth from a pocket and handed it to Hoshino.
"Wrap it up in this. Better for people not to see it."
"I told you it was stealing!"
"Are you deaf? It's not stealing. We need it for something important, so we're just
borrowing it for a while."
"Okay, okay. I get it. Following the rules of dramaturgy, we're of necessity
moving matter."
"Precisely," Colonel said, nodding. "See, you do understand what I'm talking
about."
Carrying the stone wrapped in the navy blue cloth, Hoshino followed the path
back out of the woods, Colonel Sanders lighting the way for him with his flashlight. The
stone was much heavier than it looked and Hoshino had to stop a few times to catch his
breath. They quickly cut across the well-lit shrine grounds so no one would see them,
then came out on a main street. Colonel Sanders hailed a cab and waited for Hoshino to
climb in with the stone.
"So I should put it next to my pillow, huh?" Hoshino asked.
"Right," Colonel Sanders said. "That's all you have to do. Don't try anything else.
Just having it there's the main thing."
"I should thank you. For showing me where the stone was."
Colonel Sanders grinned. "No need--just doing my job. Just consummating my
function. But hey--how 'bout that girl, Hoshino?"
"She was amazing."
"I'm glad to hear it."
"She was real, right? Not a fox spirit or some abstraction or something messed up
like that?"
"No spirit, no abstraction. Just one real, live sex machine. Genuine four-wheeldrive
lust. It wasn't easy to find her. So rest assured."
"Whew!" Hoshino sighed.
By the time Hoshino laid the cloth-wrapped stone next to Nakata's pillow it was
already past one a. m. He figured putting it next to Nakata's pillow instead of his own
lessened the chance of any curse. As he'd imagined, Nakata was still out like the
proverbial log. Hoshino untied the cloth so the stone was visible. He changed into his
pajamas, crawled into the other futon, and instantly fell asleep. He had one short dream-
-of a god in short pants, hairy shins sticking out, racing around a field playing a flute.
At five that morning, Nakata woke up and found the stone beside his pillow.
Chapter 31
Just after one o'clock I take coffee up to the second-floor study. The door, as always, is
open. Miss Saeki's standing by the window gazing outside, one hand resting on the
windowsill. Lost in thought, unaware that her other hand's fingering the buttons on her
blouse. This time there's no pen or writing paper on the desk. I place the coffee cup on
the desk. A thin layer of clouds covers the sky, and the birds outside are quiet for a
change.
She finally notices me and, pulled back from her thoughts, comes away from the
window, sits down at the desk, and takes a sip of coffee. She motions for me to sit in the
same chair as yesterday. I sit down and look at her across the desk, sipping her coffee.
Does she remember anything at all about what happened last night? I can't tell. She
looks like she knows everything, and at the same time like she doesn't know a thing.
Images of her naked body come to mind, memories of how different parts felt. I'm not
even sure that was the body of the woman who's here in front of me. At the time, though,
I'm a hundred percent sure.
She has on a light green, silky-looking blouse and a tight beige skirt. There's a
thin silver necklace at her throat, very chic. Like some neatly crafted object, her slim
fingers on the desk are beautifully intertwined. "So, do you like this area now?" she asks
me.
"Do you mean Takamatsu?"
"Yes."
"I don't know. I haven't seen much of it, just a few things along the way. This
library, of course, a gym, the station, the hotel... those kinds of places."
"Don't you find it boring?"
I shake my head. "I don't know yet. I haven't had time to get bored, and cities
look the same anyway. Why do you ask? Do you think it's a boring town?"
She gave a slight shrug. "When I was young I did. I was dying to get out. To
leave here and go someplace else, where something special was waiting, where I could
find more interesting people."
"Interesting people?"
Miss Saeki shakes her head slightly. "I was young," she says. "Most young people
have that feeling, I suppose. Haven't you?"
"No, I never felt that if I go somewhere else there'll be special things waiting for
me. I just wanted to be somewhere else, that's all. Anywhere but there."
"There?"
"Nogata, Nakano Ward. Where I was born and grew up."
At the sound of this name something flashed across her eyes. At least it looked
like it.
"As long as you left there, you didn't particularly care where you went?" she asks.
"That's right," I say. "Where I went wasn't the issue. I had to get out of there or
else I knew I'd get totally messed up. So I left."
She looks down at her hands resting on the desk, a very detached look in her eyes.
Then, very quietly, she says, "When I left here when I was twenty, I felt the same way. I
had to leave or else I wouldn't survive. And I was convinced I'd never see this place
again as long as I lived. I never considered coming back, but things happened and here I
am. Like I'm starting all over again." She turns around and looks out the window.
The clouds covering the sky are the same tone as before, and there isn't any wind
to speak of. The whole thing looks as still as the painted background scenery in a movie.
"Incredible things happen in life," she says.
"You mean I might go back to where I started?"
"I don't know. That's up to you, sometime well in the future. But I think where a
person is born and dies is very important. You can't choose where you're born, but
where you die you can--to some degree." She says all this in a quiet voice, staring out
the window like she's talking to some imaginary person outside. Remembering I'm here,
she turns toward me. "I wonder why I'm confessing all these things to you."
"Because I'm not from around here, and our ages are so different."
"I suppose so," she says.
For twenty, maybe thirty seconds, we're lost in our own thoughts. She picks up
her cup and takes another sip of coffee.
I decide to come right out and say it. "Miss Saeki, I have something I need to
confess, too."
She looks at me and smiles. "We're exchanging secrets, I see."
"Mine isn't a secret. Just a theory."
"A theory?" she repeats. "You're confessing a theory?"
"Yes."
"Sounds interesting."
"It's a sequel to what we're talking about," I say. "What I mean is, did you come
back to this town to die?"
Like a silvery moon at dawn, a smile rises to her lips. "Perhaps I did. But it
doesn't seem to matter. Whether you come to a place to live or to die, the things you do
every day are about the same."
"Are you hoping to die?"
"I wonder...," she says. "I don't know myself."
"My father was hoping to die."
"Your father died?"
"Not long ago," I tell her. "Very recently, in fact."
"Why was your father trying to die?"
I take a deep breath. "For a long time I couldn't figure it out. But now I think I
have. After coming here I finally understand."
"Why?"
"My father was in love with you, but couldn't get you back. Or maybe from the
very beginning he couldn't really make you his. He knew that, and that's why he wanted
to die. And that's also why he wanted his son--your son, too--to murder him. Me, in
other words. He wanted me to sleep with you and my older sister, too. That was his
prophecy, his curse. He programmed all this inside me."
Miss Saeki returns her coffee cup to the saucer with a hard, neutral sound. She
looks straight at me, but she's not really seeing me. She's gazing at some void, some
blank space somewhere else. "Do I know your father?"
I shake my head. "As I told you, it's just a theory."
She rests her hands on the desk, one on top of the other. Faint traces of a smile
remain. "In your theory, then, I'm your mother."
"That's right," I say. "You lived with my father, had me, and then went away,
leaving me behind. In the summer when I'd just turned four."
"So that's your theory."
I nod.
"Which explains why you asked me yesterday whether I have any children?"
Again I nod.
"I told you I couldn't answer that. Couldn't give you a yes or a no."
"I know."
"So your theory remains speculative."
I nod again. "That's right."
"So tell me, how did your father die?"
"He was murdered."
"You didn't murder him, did you?"
"No, I didn't. I have an alibi."
"But you're not entirely sure?"
I shake my head. "I'm not sure at all."
She lifts the coffee cup again and takes a tiny sip, as if it has no taste. "Why did
your father put you under that curse?"
"He must've wanted me to take over his will," I say.
"To desire me, you mean."
"That's right," I say.
Miss Saeki stares into the cup in her hand, then looks up again.
"So do you--desire me?"
I give one clear nod.
She closes her eyes. I gaze at her closed eyelids for a long time, and through them
I can see the darkness that she's seeing. Odd shapes loom up in it, floating up only to
disappear.
Finally she opens her eyes. "You mean in theory you desire me."
"No, apart from the theory. I want you, and that goes way beyond any theory."
"You want to have sex with me?"
I nod.
She narrows her eyes like something's shining in them. "Have you ever had sex
with a girl before?"
I nod again. Last night--with you, I think. But I can't say it out loud. She doesn't
remember a thing.
Something close to a sigh escapes her lips. "Kafka, I know you realize this, but
you're fifteen and I'm over fifty."
"It's not that simple. We're not talking about that sort of time here. I know you
when you were fifteen. And I'm in love with you at that age. Very much in love. And
through her, I'm in love with you. That young girl's still inside you, asleep inside you.
Once you go to sleep, though, she comes to life. I've seen it."
She closes her eyes once more, her eyelids trembling slightly.
"I'm in love with you, and that's what's important. I think you understand that."
Like someone rising to the surface of the sea from deep below, she takes a deep
breath. She searches for the words to say, but they lie beyond her grasp. "I'm sorry,
Kafka, but would you mind leaving? I'd like to be alone for a while," she says. "And
close the door on your way out."
I nod, stand up, and start to go, but something pulls me back. I stop at the door,
turn around, and walk across the room to where she is. I reach out and touch her hair.
Through the strands my hand brushes her small ear. I just can't help it.
Miss Saeki looks up, surprised, and after a moment's hesitation lays her hand on
mine. "At any rate, you--and your theory--are throwing a stone at a target that's very far
away. Do you understand that?"
I nod. "I know. But metaphors can reduce the distance."
"We're not metaphors."
"I know," I say. "But metaphors help eliminate what separates you and me."
A faint smile comes to her as she looks up at me. "That's the oddest pickup line
I've ever heard."
"There're a lot of odd things going on--but I feel like I'm slowly getting closer to
the truth."
"Actually getting closer to a metaphorical truth? Or metaphorically getting closer
to an actual truth? Or maybe they supplement each other?"
"Either way, I don't think I can stand the sadness I feel right now," I tell her.
"I feel the same way."
"So you did come back to this town to die."
She shakes her head. "To be honest about it, I'm not trying to die. I'm just waiting
for death to come. Like sitting on a bench at the station, waiting for the train."
"And do you know when the train's going to arrive?"
She takes her hand away from mine and touches her eyelids with the tips of her
fingers. "Kafka, I've worn away so much of my own life, worn myself away. At a
certain point I should have stopped living, but didn't. I knew life was pointless, but I
couldn't give up on it. So I ended up just marking time, wasting my life in pointless
pursuits. I wound up hurting myself, and that made me hurt others around me. That's
why I'm being punished now, why I'm under a kind of curse. I had something too
complete, too perfect, once, and afterward all I could do was despise myself. That's the
curse I can never escape. So I'm not afraid of death. And to answer your question--yes, I
have a pretty good idea of when the time is coming."
Once more I take her hand in mine. The scales are shaking, and just a tiny weight
would send them tipping to one side or the other. I have to think. I have to decide. I have
to take a step forward. "Miss Saeki, would you sleep with me?" I ask.
"You mean even if I were your mother in that theory of yours?"
"It's like everything around me's in flux--like it all has a doubled meaning."
She ponders this. "That might not be true for me, though. For me, things might
not be so nuanced. It might be more like all or nothing."
"And you know which it is."
She nods.
"Do you mind if I ask you a question?"
"About what?"
"Where did you come up with those two chords?"
"Chords?"
"The ones in the bridge in 'Kafka on the Shore.'"
She looks at me. "You like them?"
I nod.
"I found those chords in an old room, very far away. The door to the room was
open then," she says quietly. "A room that was far, far away." She closes her eyes and
sinks back into memories. "Kafka, close the door when you leave," she says.
And that's exactly what I do.
After we close up the library for the night, Oshima drives me to a seafood
restaurant a little way away. Through a large window in the restaurant we can see the
night sea, and I think about all the creatures living under the water.
"Sometimes you've got to get out and eat some decent food," he tells me. "Relax.
I don't think the cops have staked the place out. We both needed a change of scenery."
We eat a huge salad, and split an order of paella.
"I'd love to go to Spain someday," Oshima says.
"Why Spain?"
"To fight in the Spanish Civil War."
"But that ended a long time ago."
"I know that. Lorca died, and Hemingway survived," Oshima says. "But I still
have the right to go to Spain and be a part of the Spanish Civil War."
"Metaphorically."
"Exactly," he says, giving me a wry look. "A hemophiliac of undetermined sex
who's hardly ever set foot outside Shikoku isn't about to actually go off to fight in Spain,
I would think."
We attack the mound of paella, washing it down with Perrier.
"Have there been any developments in my father's case?" I ask.
"Nothing to report, really. Except for a typical smug memorial piece in the arts
section, there hasn't been much in the papers. The investigation must be stuck. The sad
fact is the arrest rate's been going down steadily these days--just like the stock market. I
mean, the police can't even track down the son who's disappeared."
"The fifteen-year-old youth."
"Fifteen, with a history of violent behavior," Oshima adds. "The obsessed young
runaway."
"How about that incident with things falling from the sky?"
Oshima shakes his head. "They're taking a break on that one. Nothing else weird
has fallen from the sky--unless you count that award-winning lightning we had two days
ago."
"So things have settled down?"
"It seems like it. Or maybe we're just in the eye of the storm."
I nod, pick up a clam, yank out the meat with a fork, then put the shell on a plate
full of empty shells.
"Are you still in love?" Oshima asks me.
I nod. "How about you?"
"Am I in love, do you mean?"
I nod again.
"In other words, you're daring to get personal and ask about the antisocial
romance that colors my warped, homosexual, Gender-Identity-Disordered life?"
I nod, and he follows suit.
"I have a partner, yes," he admits. He makes a serious face and eats a clam. "It's
not the kind of passionate, stormy love you find in a Puccini opera or anything. We keep
a careful distance from each other. We don't get together that often, but we do
understand each other at a deep, basic level."
"Understand each other?"
"Whenever Haydn composed, he always made sure to dress formally, even to
wearing a powdered wig."
I look at him in surprise. "What's Haydn got to do with anything?"
"He couldn't compose well unless he did that."
"How come?"
"I have no idea. That's between Haydn and his wig. Nobody else would
understand. Inexplicable, I imagine."
I nod. "Tell me, when you're alone do you sometimes think about your partner
and feel sad?"
"Of course," he says. "It happens sometimes. When the moon turns blue, when
birds fly south, when--"
"Why of course?" I ask.
"Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves. So
anyone who's in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It's like stepping back
inside a room you have fond memories of, one you haven't seen in a long time. It's just a
natural feeling. You're not the person who discovered that feeling, so don't go trying to
patent it, okay?"
I lay my fork down and look up.
"A fond, old, faraway room?"
"Exactly," Oshima says. He holds his fork straight up for emphasis. "Just a
metaphor, of course."
Miss Saeki comes to my room after nine that night. I'm sitting at the desk reading
a book when I hear her Golf pull into the parking lot. The door slams shut. Rubber-soled
shoes slowly crunch across the parking lot. And finally there's a knock at my door. I
open the door, and there she is. This time she's wide awake. She has on a pinstriped silk
blouse, thin blue jeans, white deck shoes. I've never seen her in pants before.
"I haven't seen this room in a long time," she says. She stands by the wall and
looks at the painting. "Or this picture, either."
"Is the place in the painting around here?" I ask.
"Do you like it?"
I nod. "Who painted it?"
"A young artist who boarded that summer with the Komuras," she says. "He
wasn't very famous, at least at the time. I've forgotten his name. He was a very friendly
person, though, and I think he did a good job with the painting. There's something, I
don't know--powerful about it. I sat beside him the whole time and watched him work. I
made all kinds of half-joking suggestions as he painted. We got along well. It was a
summer a long time ago. I was twelve then. The boy in the painting was twelve, too."
"It looks like the sea around here."
"Let's go for a walk," she says. "I'll take you there."
I walk with her to the shore. We cut through a pine forest and walk down the
sandy beach. The clouds are breaking up and a half moon shines down on the waves.
Small waves that barely reach the shore, barely break. She sits down at a spot on the
sand, and I sit down next to her. The sand's still faintly warm.
Like she's checking the angle, she points to a spot on the shoreline. "It was right
over there," she says. "He painted that spot from here. He put the deck chair over there,
had the boy pose in it, and set up his easel right around here. I remember it well. Do you
notice how the position of the island is the same as in the painting?"
I follow where she's pointing, and sure enough it's the same. No matter how long
I gaze at it, though, it doesn't look like the place in the painting. I tell her that.
"It's changed completely," Miss Saeki replies. "That was forty years ago, after all.
Things change. A lot of things affect the shoreline--waves, wind, typhoons. Sand gets
washed away, they truck more in. But this is definitely the spot. I remember what
occurred there very well. That was the summer I had my first period, too."
We sit there looking at the scenery. The clouds shift and the moonlight dapples
the sea. Wind blows through the pine forest, sounding like a crowd of people sweeping
the ground at the same time. I scoop up some sand and let it slowly spill out between my
fingers. It falls to the beach and, like lost time, becomes part of what's already there. I do
this over and over.
"What are you thinking about?" Miss Saeki asks me.
"About going to Spain," I reply.
"What are you going to do there?"
"Eat some delicious paella."
"That's all?"
"And fight in the Spanish Civil War."
"That ended over sixty years ago."
"I know," I tell her. "Lorca died, and Hemingway survived."
"But you want to be a part of it."
I nod. "Yup. Blow up bridges and stuff."
"And fall in love with Ingrid Bergman."
"But in reality I'm here in Takamatsu. And I'm love with you."
"Tough luck."
I put my arm around her.
You put your arm around her.
She leans against you. And a long spell of time passes.
"Did you know that I did this exact same thing a long time ago? Right in this
same spot?"
"I know," you tell her.
"How do you know that?' Miss Saeki asks, and looks you in the eyes.
"I was there then."
"Blowing up bridges?"
"Yes, I was there, blowing up bridges."
"Metaphorically."
"Of course."
You hold her in your arms, draw her close, kiss her. You can feel the strength
deserting her body.
"We're all dreaming, aren't we?" she says.
All of us are dreaming.
"Why did you have to die?"
"I couldn't help it," you reply.
Together you walk along the beach back to the library. You turn off the light in
your room, draw the curtains, and without another word climb into bed and make love.
Pretty much the same sort of lovemaking as the night before. But with two differences.
After sex, she starts to cry. That's one. She buries her face in the pillow and silently
weeps. You don't know what to do. You gently lay a hand on her bare shoulder. You
know you should say something, but don't have any idea what. Words have all died in
the hollow of time, piling up soundlessly at the dark bottom of a volcanic lake. And this
time as she leaves you can hear the engine of her car. That's number two. She starts the
engine, turns it off for a time, like she's thinking about something, then turns the key
again and drives out of the parking lot. That blank, silent interval between leaves you
sad, so terribly sad. Like fog from the sea, that blankness wends its way into your heart
and remains there for a long, long time. Finally it's a part of you.
She leaves behind a damp pillow, wet with her tears. You touch the warmth with
your hand and watch the sky outside gradually lighten. Far away a crow caws. The Earth
slowly keeps on turning. But beyond any of those details of the real, there are dreams.
And everyone's living in them.
Chapter 32
When Nakata woke up at five a. m. he saw the big stone right next to his pillow.
Hoshino was still sound asleep on the futon next to his, mouth half open, hair sticking
every which way, Chunichi Dragons cap tossed beside him. His sleeping face had a
determined no-matter-what-don't-dare-wake-me-up look to it.
Nakata wasn't particularly surprised to find the stone there. His mind adapted
immediately to the new reality, accepted it, didn't question why it happened to be there.
Figuring out cause and effect was never his strong suit.
He sat down formally beside his bed, legs tucked neatly under him, and spent
some quality time with the stone, gazing intently at it. Finally he reached out and, like
he was stroking a large, sleeping cat, touched it. At first gingerly, with only his
fingertips, and when that seemed safe he ran his entire hand carefully over the whole
surface. All the while he rubbed it, he was thinking--or at least had the pensive look of
someone thinking. As if reading a map, he ran his hand over every part of the stone,
memorizing every bump and cranny, getting a solid sense of it. Then he suddenly
reached up and rubbed his short hair, searching, perhaps, for the correlation between the
stone and his own head.
Finally he gave what might have been a sigh, stood up, opened the window, and
stuck his face out. All that was visible was the rear of the building next door. A shabby,
miserable sort of building. The kind where shabby people spend one shabby day after
another doing their shabby work. The kind of fallen-from-grace sort of building you find
in any city, the kind Charles Dickens could spend ten pages describing. The clouds
floating above the building were like hard clumps of dirt from a vacuum cleaner no one
ever cleaned. Or maybe more like all the contradictions of the Third Industrial
Revolution condensed and set afloat in the sky. Regardless, it was going to rain soon.
Nakata looked down and spied a skinny black cat, tail alert, patrolling the top of a
narrow wall between the two buildings. "There's going to be lightning today," he called
out. But the cat didn't appear to hear him, didn't even turn around, just continued its
languid walk and disappeared in the shadows of the building.
Nakata set off down the hall, plastic bag with toilet kit inside in hand, to the
communal sinks. He washed his face, brushed his teeth, and shaved with a safety razor.
Each operation took time. He carefully washed his face, taking his time, carefully
brushed his teeth, taking his time, carefully shaved, taking his time. He trimmed his nose
hairs with a pair of scissors, straightened up his eyebrows, cleaned out his ears. He was
the type who took his time no matter what he did, but this morning he took everything at
an even slower pace than usual. No one else was up washing his face at this early hour,
and it was still a while before breakfast was ready. Hoshino didn't look like he'd be
getting up anytime soon. With the whole place to himself, Nakata looked in the mirror,
leisurely preparing for the day, and pictured the faces of all the cats he'd seen in the
book in the library two days before. Unable to read, he didn't know the names of the cats,
but a clear picture of each and every cat's face was etched in his memory.
"There really are a lot of cats in the world, that's for sure," he said as he cleaned
out his ears with a Q-tip. His first-ever visit to a library had made him painfully aware of
how little he knew. The amount of things he didn't know about the world was infinite.
The infinite, by definition, has no limits, and thinking about it gave him a mild migraine.
He gave up and turned his thoughts back to Cats of the World. How nice it would be, he
thought, to be able to talk with each and every cat in there. There must be all kinds of
cats in the world, all with different ways of thinking and talking. Would foreign cats
speak in foreign languages? he wondered. But this was another difficult subject, and
again his head began to throb.
After washing up, he went to the toilet and took care of business as usual. This
didn't take as long as his other ablutions. Finished, he took his plastic bag with the toilet
kit inside back to the room. Hoshino was sound asleep, exactly as he'd left him. Nakata
picked up the discarded aloha shirt and jeans, folding them up neatly. He set them down
on top of each other next to Hoshino's futon, adding the Chunichi Dragons baseball cap
on top like a summary title given to a motley collection of ideas. He took off his yukata
robe and put on his usual trousers and shirt, then rubbed his hands together and took a
deep breath.
He sat down again in front of the stone, gazing at it for a while before hesitantly
reaching out to touch it. "There's going to be thunder today," he pronounced to no one in
particular. He may have been addressing the stone. He punctuated this with a couple of
nods.
Nakata was over next to the window, running through an exercise routine, when
Hoshino finally woke up. Humming the radio exercise music quietly to himself, Nakata
moved in time to the tune.
Hoshino squinted at his watch. It was just after eight. He craned his neck to make
sure the stone was where he'd put it. In the light the stone looked much bigger and
rougher than he'd remembered. "So I wasn't dreaming after all," he said.
"I'm sorry--what did you say?" Nakata asked.
"The stone," Hoshino said. "The stone's right there. It wasn't a dream."
"We have the stone," Nakata said simply, still in the midst of his exercises,
making it sound like some central proposition of nineteenth-century German philosophy.
"It's a long story, though, Gramps, about how the stone got to be there."
"Yes, Nakata thought that might be the case."
"Anyway," Hoshino said, sitting up in bed and sighing deeply. "It doesn't matter.
The important thing is it's here. To make a long story short."
"We have the stone," Nakata repeated. "That's what matters."
Hoshino was about to respond but suddenly noticed how famished he was. "Hey,
what d'ya say we grab some breakfast?"
"Nakata's quite hungry."
After breakfast, as he was drinking tea, Hoshino said, "So what are you going to
do with the stone?"
"What should Nakata do with it?"
"Gimme a break," Hoshino said, shaking his head. "You said you had to find that
stone, so that's why I managed to come up with it last night. Don't hit me now with this
Gee whiz, what should I do with it stuff. Okay?"
"Yes, you are right. But to tell the truth, I don't know yet what I'm supposed to do
with it."
"That's a problem."
"A problem indeed," Nakata replied, though you'd never know it from his
expression.
"So if you spend some time thinking about it, you'll figure out what to do?"
"I think so. It takes Nakata much longer to do things than other people."
"Okay, but listen here, Mr. Nakata."
"Yes, Mr. Hoshino?"
"I don't know who gave it that name, but since it's called the entrance stone I'm
guessing it's gotta be the entrance to something a long time ago, don't you think? There
must be some legend or explanation about it."
"Yes, that must be the case."
"But you have no idea what kind of entrance we're talking about here?"
"No, not yet. I used to talk with cats all the time, but I've never spoken to a
stone."
"Doesn't sound like it'd be too easy."
"It's very different from talking with a cat."
"But still, ripping that stone off from a shrine--you sure we won't be cursed or
something? That's really bothering me. Taking it's one thing, but dealing with it now
that we have it could be a total pain in the butt. Colonel Sanders told me there wouldn't
be any curse, but I can't totally trust the guy, you know what I mean?"
"Colonel Sanders?"
"There's an old guy by that name. The guy on the Kentucky Fried Chicken ads.
With the white suit, beard, stupid glasses. You don't know who I mean?"
"I'm very sorry, but I don't believe I know that person."
"You don't know Kentucky Fried Chicken? That's kind of unusual. Well,
whatever. The old guy's an abstract concept anyway. He's not human, not a god or a
Buddha. He doesn't have any shape, but has to take on some sort of appearance, so he
just happened to choose the Colonel."
Nakata looked perplexed and rubbed his salt-and-pepper hair. "I don't
understand."
"Well, to tell you the truth, I don't get it either, though I'm the one spouting off,"
Hoshino said. "Anyhow, this weird old guy suddenly pops up out of nowhere and rattles
off all those things to me. Long story short, the old guy helped me out so I could locate
the stone, and I lugged it back here. I'm not trying to win your sympathy or anything, but
it was a long, hard night, I can tell you. What I'd really like to do right now is hand the
whole thing to you and let you take over."
"I will."
"That was quick."
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata said.
"What?"
"There's going to be a lot of thunder soon. Let's wait for that."
"You're telling me the thunder's going to do something to help with the stone?"
"I don't know for sure, but I'm starting to get that feeling."
"Thunder, huh? Sounds kind of cool. Okay, we'll wait and see what happens."
When they got back to their room Hoshino flopped facedown on the futon and
switched on the TV. Nothing was on except a bunch of variety shows targeted at
housewives, but since there was no other way of killing time, he kept watching, giving a
running critique of everything on the screen.
Nakata, meanwhile, sat in front of the stone, gazing at it, rubbing it, occasionally
mumbling. Hoshino couldn't catch what he was saying. For all he knew the old man
might actually be talking to the stone.
After a couple of hours, Hoshino ran out to a nearby convenience store and came
back with a sack full of milk and sweet rolls the two of them had for lunch. While they
were eating, the maid showed up to clean the room, but Hoshino told her not to bother,
they were fine.
"You're not going out anywhere?" she asked.
"Nope," he answered. "We've got something to do here."
"Because there's going to be thunder," Nakata added.
"Thunder. I see...," the maid said dubiously before she left, looking like she'd
rather not have anything more to do with this weird pair.
Around noon thunder rumbled dully off in the distance, and, as if waiting for a
signal, it started sprinkling. Unimpressive thunder, a lazy dwarf trampling on a drum.
Before long, though, the raindrops grew larger, and it was soon a regular downpour,
wrapping the world in a wet, stuffy smell.
Once the thunder started, the two sat down across from each other, the stone
between them, like Indians passing a peace pipe. Nakata was still mumbling to himself,
rubbing the stone or his head. Hoshino puffed on a Marlboro and watched.
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata said.
"What's up?"
"Would you stay with me for a while?"
"Sure. I'm not going anywhere in this rain."
"There's a chance something strange might happen."
"Are you kidding me?" Hoshino began. "Everything's been strange enough
already."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah."
"All of a sudden I was wondering--what am I, anyway? What is Nakata?"
Hoshino pondered this. "That's a tough one. A little out of left field. I mean, I
don't even know what I am, so I'm not the guy to ask. Thinking isn't exactly my thing,
you know? But I know you're an okay, honest guy. You're out of kilter big-time, but
you're somebody I trust. That's why I came with you all the way to Shikoku. I may not
be so bright, either, but I do have an eye for people."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"It's not just that I'm dumb. Nakata's empty inside. I finally understand that.
Nakata's like a library without a single book. It wasn't always like that. I used to have
books inside me. For a long time I couldn't remember, but now I can. I used to be
normal, just like everybody else. But something happened and I ended up like a
container with nothing inside."
"Yeah, but if you look at it like that we're all pretty much empty, don't you think?
You eat, take a dump, do your crummy job for your lousy pay, and get laid occasionally,
if you're lucky. What else is there? Still, you know, interesting things do happen in life--
like with us now. I'm not sure why. My grandpa used to say that things never work out
like you think they will, but that's what makes life interesting, and that makes sense. If
the Chunichi Dragons won every single game, who'd ever watch baseball?"
"You liked your grandfather a lot, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did. If it hadn't been for him I don't know what would've happened to me.
He made me feel like I should try and make something of myself. He made me feel--I
don't know--connected. That's why I quit the motorcycle gang and joined the Self-
Defense Force. Before I knew it, I wasn't getting in trouble anymore."
"But you know, Mr. Hoshino, Nakata doesn't have anybody. Nothing. I'm not
connected at all. I can't read. And my shadow's only half of what it should be."
"Everybody has their shortcomings."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"If I'd been my normal self, I think I would've lived a very different kind of life.
Like my two younger brothers. I would have gone to college, worked in a company,
gotten married and had a family, driven a big car, played golf on my days off. But I
wasn't normal, so that's why I'm the Nakata I am today. It's too late to do it over. I
understand that. But still, even for a short time, I'd like to be a normal Nakata. Up until
now there was never anything in particular I wanted to do. I always did what people told
me as best I could. Maybe that just became a habit. But now I want to go back to being
normal. I want to be a Nakata with his own ideas, his own meaning."
Hoshino sighed. "If that's what you want, then go for it. Not that I have a clue
what a normal Nakata's like."
"Nakata doesn't either."
"I just hope it works out. I'll be praying for you--that you can be normal again."
"Before I get back to being normal, though, there are some things I have to take
care of."
"Like what?"
"Like Johnnie Walker."
"Johnnie Walker?" Hoshino said. "Yeah, you mentioned that before. You mean
the whisky guy?"
"Yes. I went to the police right away, and told them about him. I knew I had to
report to the Governor, but they wouldn't listen. So I have to find a solution on my own.
I have to take care of that before I can be a normal Nakata again. If that's possible."
"I don't really get it, but I guess you're saying you need this stone to do whatever
it is you need to do."
"That's right. I have to get the other half of my shadow back."
By this time the thunder was deafening. Lightning zigzagged across the sky,
followed, a moment later, by the roar of thunder. The air shook, and the loose
windowpanes rattled nervously. Dark clouds capped the whole sky, and it got so dark
inside they could barely make out each other's faces. They left the light off, however.
They were still seated as before, with the stone between them. The rain was lashing
down so hard it felt suffocating just to look at it. Each flash of lightning lit up the room
for an instant. They didn't say anything for a while.
"Okay, but why do you have to have anything to do with this stone, Mr. Nakata?"
Hoshino asked when the thunder had died down a bit. "Why does it have to be you?"
"Because I'm the one who's gone in and come out again."
"I don't follow you."
"I left here once, and came back again. It happened when Japan was in a big war.
The lid came open, and I left here. By chance I came back. That's why I'm not normal,
and my shadow's only half of what it was. But then I could talk with cats, though I can't
do it well anymore. I can also make things fall from the sky."
"Like those leeches?"
"Yes."
"A pretty unique talent, that's for sure."
"That's right, not everybody can do it."
"And that's because you went out and came back again? I guess you really are
pretty extraordinary."
"After I came back I wasn't normal anymore. I couldn't read. And I've never
touched a woman."
"That's hard to believe."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"I'm scared. As I told you, I'm completely empty. Do you know what it means to
be completely empty?"
Hoshino shook his head. "I guess not."
"Being empty is like a vacant house. An unlocked, vacant house. Anybody can
come in, anytime they want. That's what scares me the most. I can make things rain
from the sky, but most of the time I don't have any idea what I'm going to make rain
next. If it were ten thousand knives, or a huge bomb, or poison gas--I don't know what
I'd do.... I could say I'm sorry to everybody, but that wouldn't be enough."
"You got that right," Hoshino said. "Just apologizing wouldn't cut it. Leeches are
bad enough, but those things are even worse."
"Johnnie Walker went inside Nakata. He made me do things I didn't want to.
Johnnie Walker used me, but I didn't have the strength to fight it. Because I don't have
anything inside me."
"Which explains why you want to go back to being a normal Nakata. One with
substance?"
"That's exactly right. I'm not very bright, but I could build furniture, and I did it
day after day. I liked making things--desks, chairs, chests. It's nice to make things with
nice shapes. Those years I made furniture, I never thought about wanting to be normal
again. And there wasn't anyone I knew who tried to get inside me. Nakata never felt
afraid of anything. But after meeting Johnnie Walker I got very afraid."
"So what did this Johnnie Walker make you do after he got inside you?"
A loud rumble ripped through the sky, and the lightning was close by, by the
sound of it. Hoshino's eardrums were stinging from the roar.
Nakata inclined his head slightly to one side, listening carefully, slowly rubbing
the surface of the stone all the while. "He made me shed blood."
"Blood?"
"Yes, but it didn't stick to Nakata's hands."
Hoshino pondered this for a while, puzzled. "Anyway, once you open the
entrance stone, all sorts of things will naturally settle back where they're meant to be,
right? Like water flowing from high places to low places?"
Nakata considered this. "It might not be that easy. Nakata's job is to find the
entrance stone, and open it. What happens after that, I'm afraid I don't know."
"Okay, but why's the stone in Shikoku?"
"The stone is everywhere. Not just in Shikoku. And it doesn't have to be a stone."
"I don't get it.... If it's everywhere, then you could've done all this back home in
Nakano. That would've saved a lot of time and effort."
Nakata rubbed a palm over his close-cropped hair. "That's a hard question. I've
been listening to the stone for a while now but can't understand it all that well yet. But I
do think both of us had to come here. We had to cross a big bridge. It wouldn't have
worked in Nakano Ward."
"Can I ask you something else?"
"Yes."
"If you do open the entrance stone here, is something amazing going to happen?
Like is what's-his-name, that genie, going to pop out like in Aladdin? Or a prince that's
been turned into a frog will French-kiss me? Or else we'll be eaten alive by Martians?"
"Something might happen, but then again maybe nothing. I haven't opened it yet,
so I don't know. You can't know until you open it."
"But it might be dangerous, huh?"
"Yes, exactly."
"Jeez." Hoshino pulled a Marlboro out of his pocket and lit it. "My grandpa used
to always tell me that my bad point was running off with people I didn't know without
thinking what I was doing. I guess I must have always done that. The child's the father
of the man, like they say. Anyhow, there's nothing I can do about it now. I've come all
this way, and gone to all the trouble of locating the stone, so I can't just head on home
without seeing it through. We know it might be dangerous, but what the hell. Why don't
we open it up and see what happens? At least it'll make a great story for the grandkids."
"Nakata has a favor to ask you, Mr. Hoshino."
"What's that?"
"Could you pick up the stone?"
"No problem."
"It's a lot heavier than when you brought it."
"I know I'm no Schwarzenegger, but I'm stronger than I look. In the SDF I got
second place in our unit's arm-wrestling contest. Plus you've cured my back problems,
so I can give it everything I've got."
Hoshino stood up, grabbed the stone in both hands, and tried to lift it. The stone
didn't budge an inch. "You're right, it is a lot heavier," he said, gasping. "A while ago,
lifting it up was no problem. Now it feels like it's nailed to the floor."
"It's the valuable entrance stone, so it can't be moved easily. If it could, that
would be a problem."
"I suppose so."
Right then a few irregular flashes of light ripped through the sky, and a series of
thunderclaps shook the earth to its core. It's like somebody just opened the lid to hell,
Hoshino thought. One final clap of thunder boomed nearby and suddenly there was a
thick, suffocating silence. The air was damp and stagnant, with a hint of something
suspicious, as if countless ears were floating in the air, waiting to pick up a trace of
some conspiracy. The two men were frozen, wrapped in the midday darkness. Suddenly
the wind picked up again, lashing rain against the window. Thunder rumbled, but not as
violently as before. The center of the storm had passed the city.
Hoshino looked up and swept the room with his eyes. Everything seemed
strangely cold and distant, the four walls even more blank than before. The Marlboro
butt in the ashtray had turned to ash. He swallowed and brushed the silence from his
ears. "Hey, Mr. Nakata?"
"What is it, Mr. Hoshino?"
"I feel like I'm having a bad dream."
"Well, at least we're having the same dream."
"You're right," Hoshino said, and scratched his earlobe in resignation. "Right you
are, right as rain, rain rain go away, come again some other day.... Anyway, that makes
me feel better." He then stood up once more, to try to move the stone. He took a deep
breath, grabbed it, and focused all his strength in his hands. With a low grunt he
managed to lift the stone an inch or two.
"You moved it a little," Nakata said.
"So we know it's not nailed down. But I've got to move it more than that, I guess."
"You need to flip it completely over."
"Like a pancake."
Nakata nodded "That's right. Pancakes are one of Nakata's favorites."
"Glad to hear it. So they have pancakes in hell, huh? Anyway, let me give it one
more try. I think I can flip this thing over."
Hoshino closed his eyes and summoned up every ounce of strength, concentrating
it on this one action. This is it! he told himself. Now or never!
He got a good grip, carefully tightened it, then took a huge breath, let out a gutwrenching
yell, and all at once lifted the stone, holding it in the air at a forty-five-degree
angle. That was the limit of his strength. Somehow, he was able to hold it in that
position. He gasped, his whole body aching, his bones and muscles and nerves
screaming in pain, but he wasn't about to give up. He took in one last deep breath and
gave out a battle cry, but couldn't hear his own voice. He had no idea what he was
saying. Eyes shut tight, he managed to drag out a strength he never knew he had,
strength that should have been beyond him. Lack of oxygen made everything go white.
One after another his nerves snapped like popping fuses. He couldn't see or hear a thing,
or even think. There wasn't enough air. Still, he inched the stone upward and, with a
final yell, tipped it over. He lost his grip, and the weight of the stone itself flipped it over.
A massive thud rattled the room as if the whole building was shaking.
The recoil sent Hoshino tumbling backward. He lay there, sprawled faceup on the
tatami, gasping for air, his head filled with soft mud whirling round and round. I don't
think, he thought, I'll ever lift something this heavy again as long as I live. (Later on,
though, it turned out that this prediction was overly optimistic.)
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Wh--what?"
"The entrance opened up, thanks to you."
"You know something, Gramps? I mean, Mr. Nakata?"
"What is it?"
Faceup, eyes still shut, Hoshino took another long, deep breath and exhaled. "It
better have opened up. Otherwise I killed myself for nothing."
Chapter 33
I get the library all ready to open up before Oshima arrives. Vacuum all the floors, wipe
the windows, clean the restroom, wipe off all the chairs and desks. Spray the banister,
polish it up nicely. Carefully dust the stained glass on the landing. Sweep the garden,
switch on the AC in the reading room and the storeroom's dehumidifier. Make coffee,
sharpen pencils. A deserted library in the morning--there's something about it that really
gets to me. All possible words and ideas are there, resting quietly. I want to do what I
can to preserve this place, keep it neat and tidy. Sometimes I come to a halt and gaze at
all the silent books on the stacks, reach out and touch the spines of a few. At ten-thirty,
as always, the Mazda Miata roars into the parking lot and Oshima appears, looking a
little sleepy. We chat for a while till it's time to open up.
"If it's okay, I'd like to go out for a while," I tell him right after we open up.
"Where to?"
"I need to go to the gym and work out. I haven't gotten any exercise for a while."
That isn't the only reason. Miss Saeki comes in to work late in the morning, and I
don't want to run into her. I need some time to get my head together before I see her
again.
Oshima looks at me and, after a pause, nods. "Watch out, though. I don't want to
henpeck you, but you can't be too careful, okay?"
"Don't worry, I'll be careful," I assure him.
Backpack slung from one shoulder, I board the train. At Takamatsu Station I take
a bus to the fitness club. I change into my gym clothes in the locker room, then do some
circuit training, plugged into my Walkman, Prince blasting away. It's been a while and
my muscles complain, but I manage. It's the body's normal reaction--muscles screaming
out, resisting the extra burden put on them. Listening to "Little Red Corvette," I try to
soothe that reaction, suppress it. I take a deep breath, hold it, exhale. Inhale, hold, exhale.
Even breathing, over and over. One by one I push my muscles to the limit. I'm sweating
like crazy, my shirt's soaked and heavy. I have to go over to the cooler a few times to
gulp down water.
I go through the machines in the usual order, my mind filled with Miss Saeki.
About the sex we had. I try to clear my head, blank everything out, but it's not easy. I
focus on my muscles, absorb myself in the routine. The same machines as always, same
weights, same number of reps. Prince is singing "Sexy Motherfucker" now. The end of
my penis is still a bit sore and stings a little when I take a leak. The tip's red. My freshfrom-
the-foreskin cock is still plenty young and tender. Condensed sexual fantasies,
Prince's slippery voice, quotes from all kinds of books--the whole confused mess swirls
around in my brain, and my head feels like it's about to burst.
I take a shower, change into fresh underwear, and take the bus back to the station.
Hungry, I duck inside a diner and have a quick meal. As I'm eating I realize this is where
I ate on my first day in Takamatsu. Which gets me wondering how many days I've been
here. It's been a week or so since I started staying at the library, so I must have gotten to
Shikoku about three weeks ago.
I have some tea after I'm finished eating and watch the people hustling back and
forth in front of the station. They're all headed somewhere. If I wanted to, I could join
them. Take a train to some other place. Throw away everything here, head off
somewhere I've never been, start from scratch. Like turning a new page in a notebook. I
could go to Hiroshima, Fukuoka, wherever. Nothing's keeping me here. I'm one hundred
percent free. Everything I need to get by for a while is in my backpack. Clothes, toilet
kit, sleeping bag. I've hardly touched the cash I took from my father's study.
But I know I can't go anywhere.
"But you can't go anywhere, you know that very well," the boy named Crow says.
You held Miss Saeki, came inside her so many times. And she took it all. Your
penis is still stinging, still remembering how it felt to be inside her. One of the places
that's just for you. You think of the library. The tranquil, silent books lining the stacks.
You think of Oshima. Your room. Kafka on the Shore hanging on the wall, the fifteenyear-
old girl gazing at the painting. You shake your head. There's no way you can leave
here. You aren't free. But is that what you really want? To be free?
Inside the station I pass by patrolmen making their rounds, but they don't pay me
any mind. Seems like every other guy I pass is some tanned kid my age shouldering a
backpack. And I'm just one of them, melting into the scenery. No need to get all jumpy.
Just act natural, and nobody'll notice me.
I jump on the little two-car train and return to the library.
"Hey, you're back," Oshima says. He looks at my backpack, dumbfounded. "My
word, do you always lug around so much luggage with you? You're a regular Linus."
I boil some water and have a cup of tea. Oshima's twirling his usual long, freshly
sharpened pencil. Where his pencils wind up when they get too short I have no idea.
"That backpack's like your symbol of freedom," he comments.
"Guess so," I say.
"Having an object that symbolizes freedom might make a person happier than
actually getting the freedom it represents."
"Sometimes," I say.
"Sometimes," he repeats. "You know, if they had a contest for the world's shortest
replies, you'd win hands down."
"Perhaps."
"Perhaps," Oshima says, as if fed up. "Perhaps most people in the world aren't
trying to be free, Kafka. They just think they are. It's all an illusion. If they really were
set free, most people would be in a real bind. You'd better remember that. People
actually prefer not being free."
"Including you?"
"Yeah. I prefer being unfree, too. Up to a point. Jean-Jacques Rousseau defined
civilization as when people build fences. A very perceptive observation. And it's true--
all civilization is the product of a fenced-in lack of freedom. The Australian Aborigines
are the exception, though. They managed to maintain a fenceless civilization until the
seventeenth century. They're dyed-in-the-wool free. They go where they want, when
they want, doing what they want. Their lives are a literal journey. Walkabout is a perfect
metaphor for their lives. When the English came and built fences to pen in their cattle,
the Aborigines couldn't fathom it. And, ignorant to the end of the principle at work, they
were classified as dangerous and antisocial and were driven away, to the outback. So I
want you to be careful. The people who build high, strong fences are the ones who
survive the best. You deny that reality only at the risk of being driven into the
wilderness yourself."
I go back to my room and lay down my backpack. Next I head to the kitchen,
brew up some coffee, and take it to Miss Saeki's room. Metal tray in both hands, I
carefully walk up each step, the old floorboards creaking. On the landing, I step through
a rainbow of brilliant colors from the stained glass.
Miss Saeki's sitting at her desk, writing. I put down the coffee cup, and she looks
up and asks me to sit down in my usual chair. Today she has on a café-au-lait-colored
shirt over a black T-shirt. Her hair's pinned back, and she's wearing a pair of small pearl
earrings.
She doesn't say anything for a while. She's looking over what she's just written.
Nothing in her expression looks out of the ordinary. She screws on the cap of her
fountain pen and lays it on top of her writing paper. She spreads her fingers, checking
for ink stains. Sunday-afternoon sunlight is shining through the window. Somebody's
outside in the garden, talking.
"Mr. Oshima told me you went to the gym," she says, studying my face.
"That's right," I say.
"What kind of exercise do you do there?"
"I use the machines and the free weights," I reply.
"Anything else?"
I shake my head.
"Kind of a lonely type of sport, isn't it?"
I nod.
"I imagine you want to become stronger."
"You have to be strong to survive. Especially in my case."
"Because you're all alone."
"Nobody's going to help me. At least no one has up till now. So I have to make it
on my own. I have to get stronger--like a stray crow. That's why I gave myself the name
Kafka. That's what Kafka means in Czech, you know--crow."
"Hmm," she says, mildly impressed. "So you're Crow."
"That's right," I say.
That's right, the boy named Crow says.
"There must be a limit to that kind of lifestyle, though," she says. "You can't use
that strength as a protective wall around you. There's always going to be something
stronger that can overcome your fortress. At least in principle."
"Strength itself becomes your morality."
Miss Saeki smiles. "You catch on quickly."
"The strength I'm looking for isn't the kind where you win or lose. I'm not after a
wall that'll repel power coming from outside. What I want is the kind of strength to be
able to absorb that outside power, to stand up to it. The strength to quietly endure things-
-unfairness, misfortune, sadness, mistakes, misunderstandings."
"That's got to be the most difficult strength of all to make your own."
"I know...."
Her smile deepens one degree. "You seem to know everything."
I shake my head. "That's not true. I'm only fifteen, and there're plenty of things I
don't know. I should know them, but I don't. I don't know anything about you, for one
thing."
She picks up the coffee cup and takes a sip. "There's nothing that you have to
know, nothing inside me you need to know."
"Do you remember my theory?"
"Of course," she says. "But that's your theory, not mine. So I have no
responsibility for it, right?"
"Exactly. The person who comes up with the theory is the one who has to prove
it," I say. "Which leads me to a question."
"About?"
"You told me you'd published a book about people who'd been struck by
lightning."
"That's right."
"Is it still available?"
She shakes her head. "They didn't print that many copies to begin with. It went
out of print a long time ago, and I imagine any leftover copies were destroyed. I don't
even have a copy. Like I said before, nobody was interested."
"Why were you interested in that topic?"
"I'm not sure. I guess there was something symbolic about it. Or maybe I just
wanted to keep myself busy, so I set a goal that kept me running around and my mind
occupied. I can't recall now what the original motivation was. I came up with the idea
and just started researching it. I was a writer then, with no money worries and plenty of
free time, so I could mostly do whatever sparked my interest. Once I got into it, though,
the topic itself was fascinating. Meeting all kinds of people, hearing all kinds of stories.
If it weren't for that project, I probably would've withdrawn even further from reality
and ended up completely isolated."
"When my father was young he worked as a caddy at a golf course and was hit by
lightning. He was lucky to survive. The guy with him didn't make it."
"A lot of people are killed by lightning on golf courses--big, wide-open spaces,
with almost nowhere to take shelter. And lightning loves golf clubs. Is your father also
named Tamura?"
"Yes, and I think he was about your age."
She shakes her head. "I don't remember anybody named Tamura. I didn't
interview anybody by that name."
I don't say anything.
"That's part of your theory, isn't it? That your father and I met while I was
researching the book, and as a result you were born."
"Yes."
"Well, that puts an end to it, doesn't it? That never happened. Your theory doesn't
stand up."
"Not necessarily," I say.
"What do you mean?"
"Because I don't believe everything you're telling me."
"Why not?"
"Well, you immediately said you'd never interviewed anybody called Tamura
without even giving it any thought. Twenty years is a long time, and you must've
interviewed quite a number of people. I don't think you'd be able to recall so quickly
whether one of them was or wasn't named Tamura."
She shakes her head and takes another sip of coffee. A faint smile springs to her
lips. "Kafka, I--" She stops, looking for the right words.
I wait for her to find them.
"I feel like things are starting to change around me," she says.
"How so?"
"I can't really say, but something's happening. The air pressure, the way sounds
reverberate, the reflection of light, how bodies move and time passes--it's all
transforming, bit by bit. It's like each small change is a drop that's steadily building up
into a stream." She picks up her black Mont Blanc pen, looks at it, puts it back where it
was, then looks straight at me. "What happened between us in your room last night is
probably part of that flow. I don't know if what we did last night was right or not. But at
the time I decided not to force myself to judge anything. If the flow is there, I figured I'd
just let it carry me along where it wanted."
"Can I tell you what I think?"
"Go right ahead."
"I think you're trying to make up for lost time."
She thinks about it for a while. "You may be right," she says. "But how do you
know that?"
"Because I'm doing the same thing."
"Making up for lost time?"
"Yes," I say. "A lot of things were stolen from my childhood. Lots of important
things. And now I have to get them back."
"In order to keep on living."
I nod. "I have to. People need a place they can go back to. There's still time to
make it, I think. For me, and for you."
She closes her eyes, and tents her fingers on top of her desk. Like she's resigned
to it, she opens her eyes again. "Who are you?" she asks. "And why do you know so
much about everything?"
You tell her she must know who you are. I'm Kafka on the Shore, you say. Your
lover--and your son. The boy named Crow. And the two of us can't be free. We're
caught up in a whirlpool, pulled beyond time. Somewhere, we were struck by lightning.
But not the kind of lightning you can see or hear.
That night you make love again. You listen as the blank within her is filled. It's a
faint sound, like fine sand on a shore crumbling in the moonlight. You hold your breath,
listening. You're inside your theory now. Then you're outside. And inside again, then
outside. You inhale, hold it, exhale. Inhale, hold it, exhale. Prince sings on, like some
mollusk in your head. The moon rises, the tide comes in. Seawater flows into a river. A
branch of the dogwood just outside the window trembles nervously. You hold her close,
she buries her face in your chest. You feel her breath against your bare skin. She traces
your muscles, one by one. Finally, she gently licks your swollen penis, as if healing it.
You come again, in her mouth. She swallows it down, as if every drop is precious. You
kiss her vagina, touching every soft, warm spot with your tongue. You become someone
else there, something else. You are somewhere else.
"There's nothing inside me you need to know," she says. Until Monday morning
dawns you hold each other, listening to time passing by.
Chapter 34
The massive bank of thunderclouds crossed the city at a lethargic pace, letting loose a
flurry of lightning bolts as if probing every nook and cranny for a long-lost morality,
finally dwindling to a faint, angry echo from the eastern sky. And right then the violent
rain came to a sudden halt, followed by an unearthly silence. Hoshino stood up and
opened the window to let in some air. The storm clouds had vanished, the sky covered
once more by a thin membrane of pale clouds. All the buildings were wet, the moist
cracks in their walls dark, like old people's veins. Water dripped off power lines and
formed puddles on the ground. Birds flew out from where they'd sought shelter, chirping
loudly as they vied for the bugs that were out themselves now that the storm had abated.
Hoshino rotated his neck from side to side a couple of times, checking out his
spine. He gave one big stretch, sat down beside the window, and gazed outside, then
pulled out his pack of Marlboros and lit up.
"You know, though, Mr. Nakata, after all that effort to turn that stone over and
open the entrance, nothing out of the ordinary happened. No frog appeared, no demons,
nothing strange at all. Which is fine by me, of course.... The stage was set with all that
noisy thunder, but I gotta tell you I'm kind of disappointed."
He didn't get a reply, so he turned around. Nakata was leaning forward with both
hands on the floor and his eyes closed. The old man looked like a feeble bug.
"What's the matter? Are you all right?" Hoshino asked.
"I'm sorry, I just seem to be a little tired. Nakata doesn't feel so well. I'd like to lie
down and sleep for a while."
Nakata's face did look awfully pale. His eyes were sunken, his fingers trembling.
Just a few hours was all it took, it seemed, for him to have aged terribly.
"Okay, I'll lay out the futon for you. Feel free to sleep as much as you want,"
Hoshino said. "But are you sure you're okay? Does your stomach hurt? Do you feel like
you're gonna hurl? Any ringing in your ears? Or maybe you have to take a dump.
Should I get a doctor? Do you have insurance?"
"Yes, the Governor gave me an insurance card, and I keep it safe in my bag."
"That's good," Hoshino said, dragging the futon out of the closet and spreading it
out. "I know this isn't the time to go into details, but it isn't the Governor of Tokyo who
gave you the card. It's a National Health card, so it's the Japanese government that
issued it to you. I don't know all that much about it, but I'm sure that's the case. The
Governor himself isn't looking after every little detail of your life, okay? So forget about
him for a while."
"Nakata understands. The Governor didn't give me the insurance card. I'll try to
forget about him for a while. Anyway, I don't think I need a doctor. If I can just get
some sleep I should be all right."
"Wait a sec. You're not going to pull one of those thirty-six-hour marathons, are
you?"
"I don't know. I don't decide how long I'm going to sleep and then stick to that."
"Well, I guess that makes sense," Hoshino admitted. "Nobody does that. Okay--
just sleep as long as you like. It's been a rough day. All that thunder, plus talking with
the stone, right? And that entrance thing opening up. Not something you see every day,
that's for sure. You had to use your head a lot, so you must be tired. Don't worry about
anything, just relax and catch some shut-eye. Let old Hoshino handle the rest."
"Much obliged. I'm always putting you out, aren't I? Nakata can never thank you
enough for all you've done. If you hadn't been with me, I wouldn't have known what to
do. And you have your own important work to do."
"Yeah, I guess so," Hoshino said in a gloomy voice. So many things had
happened, he'd completely forgotten about his job. "Now that you mention it, I really
should be getting back to work soon. The boss's blowing a gasket as we speak, I'll bet. I
phoned him and said I had to take a few days off to take care of something, but haven't
checked in since. Once I get back he'll really let me have it."
He lit up a fresh Marlboro, leisurely exhaling the smoke. He stared at a crow
perched on top of a telephone pole and made silly faces at it. "But who cares? He can
say what he likes--blow steam out of his ears for all I care. Look, I've been pulling more
than my weight for years, working my tail off. Hey, Hoshino, we're shorthanded, so how
'bout making a night run to Hiroshima? Okay, boss, I'm on it.... Always did what they
told me to do, never a complaint. Thanks to which my back got shot to hell. If you didn't
fix it for me things would've gone from bad to worse. I'm only in my mid-twenties, so
why should I ruin my health over some crummy job, right? What's wrong with a few
days off now and then? But you know, Mr. Nakata, I--"
Hoshino suddenly realized the old man was sound asleep. Eyes shut tight, face
pointed toward the ceiling, lips firmly pressed together, Nakata was breathing peacefully.
The flipped-over stone lay near his pillow.
Man, I've never seen anyone fall asleep as fast as him, Hoshino thought
admiringly.
With time on his hands, he stretched out and watched some television, but he
couldn't stand any of the insipid afternoon programs so he decided to go out. He'd run
out of clean underwear and needed to buy some. He detested washing clothes. Better to
buy some cheap underpants, he always figured, than bother with washing the old scuzzy
ones. He went to the front desk of the inn to pay for the next day and told them his
companion was asleep and they weren't to wake him up. "Not that you could if you
tried," he added.
He wandered down the streets, sniffing the post-rain scent in the air, dressed in
his usual Dragons cap, green-tinted Ray-Bans, and aloha shirt. He picked up a
newspaper at a kiosk at the station and checked how the Dragons were doing--they lost
to Hiroshima in an away game--then scanned the movie schedule and decided to see the
latest Jackie Chan film. The timing was perfect. He asked directions at the police box
and found out it was close by, so he walked. He bought his ticket, went inside, and
watched the movie, munching on peanuts.
When he got out of the movie it was already evening. He wasn't all that hungry,
but since he couldn't think of anything else to do he decided to have dinner. He popped
into a place nearby and ordered sushi and a beer. He was more tired than he realized,
and only finished half the beer.
That makes sense, though, he thought. Lifting that heavy stone, of course I'm beat.
I feel like I'm the oldest of the Three Little Pigs. All the mean old wolf's gotta do is huff
and puff and I'll be blasted all the way to Okayama.
He left the sushi bar and happened to run across a pachinko place. Before he
knew it, he was down twenty dollars. He figured it just wasn't his day, so he gave up on
pachinko and wandered around. He remembered he still hadn't bought any underwear.
Damn--that was the whole point of going out, he told himself. He went into a discount
store in the shopping district and bought underpants, white T-shirts, and socks. Now he
could finally toss his dirty underwear. He decided it was about time for a new aloha shirt
and scoured a few shops looking for one, only to conclude that the pickings in
Takamatsu were pretty slim. Summer and winter alike he always wore aloha shirts, but
that didn't mean just any aloha shirt would do.
He stopped at a nearby bakery and bought some bread, in case Nakata woke up
hungry in the middle of the night, as well as a small carton of orange juice. Next he went
to a bank and used the ATM to withdraw five hundred dollars. Checking his balance, he
found there was still quite a lot left. These past few years had been so busy that he'd
hardly had time to spend any money.
By this time it was completely dark, and he had a sudden yearning for a cup of
coffee. He looked around, spotting a sign for a café just off the main drag. It turned out
to be the kind of old-fashioned coffee shop you don't find much anymore. He went
inside, eased back onto a soft, comfortable chair, and ordered a cup. Chamber music
filtered out of the solid, British-made walnut speakers. Hoshino was the only customer.
He sank back in his chair and, for the first time in quite a while, felt completely at ease.
Everything in the shop was calming, natural, easy to feel comfortable with. The coffee,
served in a fancy cup, was rich and delicious. Hoshino closed his eyes, breathing in
quietly, and listened to the intertwining of strings and piano. He'd hardly ever listened to
classical music before, but it was soothing and put him in an introspective mood.
Sunk back in his soft chair, eyes closed, lost in the music, a number of thoughts
crossed his mind--mostly having to do with himself. But the more he thought about
himself, the less reality his existence seemed to have. He began to feel like some
meaningless appendage sitting there.
I've always been a great fan of the Chunichi Dragons, he thought, but what are the
Dragons to me, anyway? Say they beat the Giants--how's that going to make me a better
person? How could it? So why the heck have I spent all this time getting worked up like
the team was some extension of myself?
Mr. Nakata said he's empty. Maybe he is, for all I know. But what does that make
me? He said an accident when he was little made him that way--empty. But I never had
an accident. If Mr. Nakata's empty, that makes me worse than empty! At least he has
something about him--whatever it was that made me drop everything and follow him to
Shikoku. Don't ask me what that something is, though....
Hoshino ordered another cup of coffee.
"You like our coffee, then?" the gray-haired owner came over and asked.
(Hoshino didn't know this, of course, but the man used to be an official in the Ministry
of Education. After retirement, he came back to his hometown of Takamatsu and opened
up this coffee shop, where he made fine coffee and played classical music.)
"It's great. Such a nice aroma."
"I roast the beans myself. Select each bean individually."
"No wonder it's so good."
"The music doesn't bother you?"
"The music?" Hoshino replied. "No, it's great. I don't mind it at all. Not one bit.
Who's playing?"
"The Rubinstein, Heifetz, and Feuermann trio. The Million-Dollar Trio, they
were dubbed. Consummate artists. This is an old 1941 recording, but the brilliance
hasn't faded."
"It really hasn't. Good things never grow old, do they?"
"Some people prefer a more structured, classic, straightforward version of the
Archduke Trio. Like the Oistrach Trio's version."
"No, I think this one's nice," Hoshino said. "It has a, I don't know, gentle feel to
it."
"Thank you very much," the owner said, thanking him on behalf of the Million-
Dollar Trio, and went back behind the counter.
As Hoshino enjoyed his second cup he went back to his reflections. But I am
helping Mr. Nakata out. I read things for him, and I was the one who found the stone,
after all. I've hardly ever noticed this before, but it feels kind of nice to be helpful to
someone.... I don't regret any of it--skipping out on work, coming over to Shikoku. All
those crazy things happening one after another.
I feel like I'm exactly where I belong. When I'm with Mr. Nakata I can't be
bothered with all this Who am I? stuff. Maybe this is going overboard, but I bet
Buddha's followers and Jesus' apostles felt the same way. When I'm with the Buddha, I
always feel I'm where I belong--something like that. Forget about culture, truth, all that
junk. That kind of inspiration's what it's all about.
When I was little, Grandpa told me stories about Buddha's disciples. One of them
was named Myoga. The guy was a complete moron and couldn't memorize even the
simplest sutra. The other disciples always teased him. One day the Buddha said to him,
"Myoga, you're not very bright, so you don't have to learn any sutras. Instead, I'd like
you to sit at the entrance and polish everybody's shoes." Myoga was an obedient guy, so
he didn't tell his master to go screw himself. So for ten years, twenty years, he diligently
polished everybody's shoes. Then one day he achieved enlightenment and became one
of the greatest of all the Buddha's followers. That's a story Hoshino always remembered,
because he'd thought that had to be the crappiest kind of life, polishing shoes for decades.
You gotta be kidding, he thought. But when he considered it now, the story started to
take on a different undertone. Life's crappy, no matter how you cut it. He just hadn't
understood that when he was little.
These thoughts occupied him till the music, which was helping him meditate,
stopped playing.
"Hey," he called out to the owner. "What was that music called again? I forget."
"Beethoven's Archduke Trio."
"March Duke?"
"Arch. Archduke. Beethoven dedicated it to the Austrian archduke Rudolph. It's
not the official name, more like the piece's nickname. Rudolph was the son of Emperor
Leopold the Second. He was a very skilled musician, who studied piano and music
theory with Beethoven starting when he was sixteen. He looked up to Beethoven.
Archduke Rudolph didn't make a name for himself as either a pianist or a composer, but
sort of stood in the shadows lending a helping hand to Beethoven, who didn't know
much about getting ahead in the world. If it hadn't been for him, Beethoven would have
had a much tougher time."
"Those kind of people are necessary in life, huh?"
"Absolutely."
"The world would be a real mess if everybody was a genius. Somebody's got to
keep watch, take care of business."
"Exactly. A world full of geniuses would have significant problems."
"I really like that piece."
"It's beautiful. You never get tired of listening to it. I'd say it's the most refined of
all Beethoven's piano trios. He wrote it when he was forty, and never wrote another. He
must have decided he'd reached the pinnacle in the genre."
"I think I know what you mean. Reaching the pinnacle's important in everything,"
Hoshino said.
"Please come again."
"Yeah, I'll do that."
When he got back to the room Nakata was, as expected, out cold. He'd gone
through this before, so this time it didn't strike him as odd. Just let him sleep as much as
he wants, he decided. The stone was still there, right next to his pillow, and Hoshino put
his sack of bread down beside it. He took a bath and changed into his new underwear,
then balled up his old set inside a paper bag and tossed it in the trash. He crawled into
his futon and was soon sound asleep.
He woke up the next morning just before nine. Nakata was still asleep, his
breathing quiet and regular.
Hoshino went to eat breakfast alone, asking the maid not to wake up his
companion. "You can just leave the futon like it is," he said.
"Is he all right, sleeping that long?" the maid asked.
"Don't worry, he's not about to die on us. He needs to sleep to regain his strength.
I know exactly what's best for him."
He bought a paper at the station and sat on a bench and looked through the movie
listings. A theater near the station was having a François Truffaut retrospective. Hoshino
had no idea who Truffaut was, or even if it was a man or a woman, but a double feature
was a good way of killing time till evening, so he decided to go. The featured films were
The 400 Blows and Shoot the Pianist. There were only a handful of customers in the
theater. Hoshino wasn't by any means a movie buff. Occasionally he'd go see one, a
kung fu or action film. So these early works of Truffaut were over his head in spots, the
pace, as you'd expect of older films, a bit sluggish. Still, he enjoyed the unique mood,
the overall look of the films, how suggestively the characters' inner worlds were
portrayed. At the very least he wasn't bored. I wouldn't mind seeing some more films by
that guy, he told himself afterward.
He exited the theater, walked to the shopping district, and went inside the same
coffee shop as the night before. The owner remembered him. Hoshino sat in the same
chair and ordered coffee. As before, he was the sole customer. Something with stringed
instruments was playing on the stereo.
"Haydn's first cello concerto. Pierre Fournier's playing the solo," the owner
explained as he brought over Hoshino's coffee.
"It's a real natural sound," Hoshino commented.
"It is, isn't it?" the owner said. "Pierre Fournier's one of my absolute favorite
musicians. Like an elegant wine, his playing has an aroma and substance that warms the
blood and gently encourages you. I always refer to him as Maestro Fournier out of
respect. I don't know him personally, of course, but I've always felt like he's my
mentor."
Listening to Fournier's flowing, dignified cello, Hoshino was drawn back to his
childhood. He used to go to the river every day to catch fish. Nothing to worry about
back then, he reminisced. Just live each day as it came. As long as I was alive, I was
something. That was just how it was. But somewhere along the line it all changed.
Living turned me into nothing. Weird... People are born in order to live, right? But the
longer I've lived, the more I've lost what's inside me--and ended up empty. And I bet the
longer I live, the emptier, the more worthless, I'll become. Something's wrong with this
picture. Life isn't supposed to turn out like this! Isn't it possible to shift direction, to
change where I'm headed?
"Excuse me...," Hoshino called out to the owner at the register.
"Can I help you?"
"I was wondering, if you had time, could you come over and talk with me? I'd
like to know more about this Haydn guy."
The owner was happy to give a mini lecture on Haydn, the man and his music. He
was basically a reserved sort of person, but when it came to classical music he was
eloquent. He explained how Haydn became a hired musician, serving different patrons
over his long life, composing who knows how many compositions to order. Haydn was
practical, affable, humble, and generous, he said, yet also a complex person with a silent
darkness all his own inside.
"Haydn was an enigmatic figure. Nobody really knows the amount of intense
pathos he held inside him. In the feudal time he was born in, though, he was compelled
to skillfully cloak his ego in submissiveness and display a smart, happy exterior.
Otherwise he would have been crushed. A lot of people compare him unfavorably to
Bach and Mozart--both his music and the way he lived. Over his long life he was
innovative, to be sure, but never exactly on the cutting edge. But if you really pay
attention as you listen, you can catch a hidden longing for the modern ego. Like a far-off
echo full of contradictions, it's all there in Haydn's music, silently pulsating. Listen to
that chord--hear it? It's very quiet--right?--but it has a persistent, inward-moving spirit
that's filled with a pliant, youthful sort of curiosity."
"Like François Truffaut's films."
"Exactly!" the owner exclaimed happily, patting Hoshino's arm reflexively.
"You've hit it right on the head. You find the same spirit animating Truffaut. A
persistent, inward-moving spirit that's filled with a pliant, youthful sort of curiosity," he
repeated.
When the Haydn concerto was over Hoshino asked him to play the Rubinstein-
Heifetz-Feuermann version of the Archduke Trio again. While listening to this, he again
was lost in thought. Damn it, I don't care what happens, he finally decided. I'm going to
follow Mr. Nakata as long as I live. To hell with the job!
Chapter 35
When the phone rings at seven a. m. I'm still sound asleep. In my dream I was deep
inside a cave, bent over in the dark, flashlight in hand, searching for something. I hear a
voice far away at the cave's entrance calling out a name faintly. I yell out a reply, but
whoever it is doesn't seem to hear me. The person calls out my name, over and over.
Reluctantly I stand up and start heading for the entrance. A little longer and I would've
found it, I think. But inside I'm also relieved I didn't find it. That's when I wake up. I
look around, collecting the scattered bits of my consciousness. I realize the phone's
ringing, the phone at the library's reception desk. Bright sunlight's shining in through the
curtains, and Miss Saeki's no longer next to me. I'm alone in bed.
I get out of bed in my T-shirt and boxers and go out to the phone. It takes me a
while to get there but the phone keeps on ringing.
"Hello?"
"Were you asleep?" Oshima asks.
"Yeah."
"Sorry to get you up so early on a day off, but we've got a problem."
"A problem?"
"I'll tell you about it later, but you'd better not hang around there for a while.
We're going to head off soon, so get your things together. When I get there, just come
out to the parking lot and get right in the car without saying anything. Okay?"
"Okay," I reply.
I go back to my room and pack up. There's no need to rush since it only takes five
minutes to get ready. I take down the laundry I had hanging in the bathroom, stuff my
toilet kit, books, and diary in my backpack, then get dressed and straighten up the bed.
Pull the sheets tight, plump up the pillows, straighten out the covers. Covering up all
traces of what went on here. I sit down in the chair and think about Miss Saeki, who'd
been with me until a few hours before.
I have time for a quick bowl of cornflakes. Wash up the bowl and spoon and put
them away. Brush my teeth, wash my face. I'm checking out my face in the mirror when
I hear the Miata pull into the parking lot.
Even though the weather's perfect, Oshima has the tan top up. I shoulder my pack,
walk over to the car, and climb into the passenger seat. As before, Oshima does a good
job of tying my pack down on top of the trunk. He's wearing a pair of Armani-type
sunglasses, and a striped linen shirt over a white V-neck T-shirt, white jeans, and navy
blue, low-cut Converse All-Stars. Casual day-off clothes.
He hands me a navy blue cap with a North Face logo on it. "Didn't you say you
lost your hat somewhere? Use this one. It'll help hide your face a little."
"Thanks," I say, and tug on the cap.
Oshima checks me out in the cap and nods his approval. "You have sunglasses,
right?"
I nod, take my sky blue Revos from my pocket, and put them on.
"Very cool," he says. "Try putting the cap on backward."
I do as he says, turning the cap around.
Oshima nods again. "Great. You look like a rap singer from a nice family." He
shifts to first, slowly steps on the gas, and lets out the clutch.
"Where are we going?" I ask.
"The same place as before."
"The mountains in Kochi?"
Oshima nods. "Right. Another long drive." He flips on the stereo. It's a cheerful
Mozart orchestral piece I've heard before. The "Posthorn Serenade," maybe?
"Are you tired of the mountains?"
"No, I like it there. It's quiet, and I can get a lot of reading done."
"Good," Oshima says.
"So what was the problem you mentioned?"
Oshima shoots a sullen look at the rearview mirror, glances over at me, then faces
forward again. "First of all, the police got back in touch with me. Phoned my place last
night. Sounds like they're getting serious about tracking you down. They seemed pretty
intense about the whole thing."
"But I have an alibi, don't I?"
"Yes, you do. A solid alibi. The day the murder took place you were in Shikoku.
They don't doubt that. What they're thinking is you might've conspired with somebody
else."
"Conspired?"
"You might have had an accomplice."
Accomplice? I shake my head. "Where'd they get that idea?"
"They're pretty tight-lipped about it. They're pushy about asking questions, but
get all low key when you try turning the tables on them. So I spent the whole night
online, downloading information about the case. Did you know there're a couple of
websites up already about it? You're pretty famous. The wandering prince who holds the
key to the puzzle."
I give a small shrug. The wandering prince?
"With online information it's hard to separate fact from wishful thinking, but you
could summarize it like this: The police are now after a guy in his late sixties. The night
of the murder he showed up at a police box near the Nogata shopping district and
confessed to just having murdered somebody in the neighborhood. Said he stabbed him.
But he spouted out all kinds of nonsense, so the young cop on the beat tagged him as
crazy and sent him on his way without getting the whole story. Of course when the
murder came to light, the policeman knew he'd blown it. He hadn't taken down the old
man's name or address, and if his superiors heard about it there'd be hell to pay, so he
kept quiet about it. But something happened--I have no idea what--and the whole thing
came to light. The cop was disciplined, of course. Poor guy'll probably never live it
down."
Oshima downshifts to pass a white Toyota Tercel, then nimbly slips back into the
lane. "The police went all out and were able to identify the old man. They don't know
his background, but he appears to be mentally impaired. Not retarded, just a teeny bit off.
He lives by himself on welfare and some support from relatives. But he's disappeared
from his apartment. The police traced his movements and think he was hitchhiking,
heading for Shikoku. An intercity bus driver thinks he might've ridden his bus out of
Kobe. He remembered him because he had an unusual way of talking and said some
weird things. Apparently he was with some young guy in his mid-twenties. The two of
them got out at Tokushima Station. They've located the inn where they stayed, and
according to a housekeeper, they took a train to Takamatsu. The old man's movements
and yours overlap exactly. Both of you left Nogata in Nakano Ward and headed straight
for Takamatsu. A little too much of a coincidence, so naturally the police are reading
something into it--thinking that the two of you planned the whole thing together. The
National Police Agency's even getting in the act, and now they're scouring the city. We
might not be able to hide you at the library anymore, so I decided you'd better lie low in
the mountains."
"A mentally impaired old man from Nakano?"
"Ring any bells?"
I shake my head. "None."
"His address isn't far from your house. A fifteen-minute walk, apparently."
"But tons of people live in Nakano. I don't even know who lives next door."
"There's more," Oshima says, and glances at me. "He's the one who made all
those mackerel and sardines rain down from the sky in the Nogata shopping district. At
least he predicted to the police that lots of fish would fall from the sky the day before it
happened."
"That's amazing," I say.
"Isn't it?" Oshima says. "And the same day, in the evening, a huge amount of
leeches rained down on the Fujigawa rest stop on the Tomei Highway. Remember?"
"Yeah, I do."
"None of this slipped past the police, of course. They're guessing there's got to be
some connection between these events and this mystery man they're after. His
movements parallel everything so closely."
The Mozart piece ends, and another begins.
Hands on the steering wheel, Oshima shakes his head a couple of times. "A really
strange turn of events. It started out weird and is getting even weirder as it goes along.
Impossible to predict what'll happen next. One thing's for sure, though. Everything
seems to be converging right here. The old man's path and yours are bound to cross."
I close my eyes and listen to the roar of the engine. "Maybe I should go to some
other town," I tell him. "Apart from anything else, I don't want to cause you or Miss
Saeki any more trouble."
"But where would you go?"
"I don't know. But I can figure it out if you take me to the station. It doesn't really
matter."
Oshima sighs. "I don't think that's such a smart idea. The station has to be
crawling with cops, all on the lookout for a cool, tall, fifteen-year-old boy lugging a
backpack and a bunch of obsessions."
"So why not take me to a station far away that they're not staking out?"
"It's all the same. In the end they'll find you."
I don't say anything.
"Look, they haven't issued a warrant for your arrest. You're not on the mostwanted
list or anything, okay?"
I nod.
"Which means you're still free. So I don't need anybody's permission to take you
anywhere I want. I'm not breaking the law. I mean, I don't even know your real first
name, Kafka. So don't worry about me. I'm a very cautious person. Nobody's going to
nab me so easily."
"Oshima?" I say.
"Yes?"
"I didn't plan anything with anybody. If I had to kill my father, I wouldn't ask
anybody to do it."
"I know."
He stops at a red light and checks the rearview mirror, then pops a lemon drop
into his mouth and offers me one.
I slip it in my mouth. "What comes after that?"
"What do you mean?" Oshima asks.
"You said first of all. About why I have to go hide in the hills. If there's a first
reason, there's got to be a second."
Oshima stares at the red light, but it doesn't change. "Compared to the first, the
second isn't very important."
"I still want to hear it."
"It's about Miss Saeki," he says. The light finally turns green and he steps on the
gas. "You're sleeping with her, right?"
I don't know how to answer that.
"Don't worry, I'm not blaming you or anything. I just have a sense for these things,
that's all. She's a wonderful person, a very attractive lady. She's--special, in all sorts of
ways. She's a lot older than you, sure, but so what? I understand your attraction to her.
You want to have sex with her, so why not? She wants to have sex with you? More
power to her. It doesn't bother me. If you guys are okay with that, it's fine by me."
Oshima rolls the lemon drop around in his mouth. "But I think it's best if you two keep
your distance for a while. And I don't mean because of that bloody mess in Nakano."
"Why, then?"
"She's in a very delicate place right now."
"How so?"
"Miss Saeki...," he begins, searching for the rest. "What I mean is, she's dying.
I've felt it for a long time."
I raise my sunglasses and look at him closely. He's looking straight ahead as he
drives. We've turned onto the highway to Kochi. This time, surprisingly, he keeps to the
speed limit. A Toyota Supra whooshes past us.
"When you say she's dying...," I begin. "You mean she's got an incurable disease?
Cancer or leukemia or something?"
Oshima shakes his head. "That could be. But I don't know anything about her
health. For all I know she might be saddled with a disease like that. I think it's more of a
psychological issue. The will to live--something to do with that."
"You're saying she's lost the will to live?"
"I think so. Lost the will to go on living."
"Do you think she's going to kill herself?"
"No, I don't," Oshima replies. "It's just that very quietly, very steadily, she's
heading toward death. Or else death is heading toward her."
"Like a train heading toward the station?"
"Something like that," Oshima said, and stopped, his lips taut. "But then you
showed up, Kafka. Cool as a cucumber, mysterious as the real Kafka. The two of you
were drawn together and, to use the classic expression, you have a relationship."
"And then?"
For a brief moment Oshima lifts both hands off the wheel. "That's it."
I slowly shake my head. "I bet you're thinking I'm the train."
Oshima doesn't say anything for a long time. "Exactly," he finally says. "That's it,
exactly."
"That I'm bringing about her death?"
"I'm not blaming you for this, mind you," he says. "It's actually for the best."
"Why?"
He doesn't answer this. You're supposed to find the answer to that, his silence
tells me. Or maybe he's saying, It's too obvious to even think about.
I lean back in my seat, shut my eyes, and let my body go limp. "Oshima?"
"What is it?"
"I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know what direction I'm facing in.
What's right, what's wrong--whether I should keep on going ahead or turn around. I'm
totally lost."
Oshima keeps silent, no answer forthcoming.
"You've got to help me. What am I supposed to do?" I ask him.
"You don't have to do anything," he says simply.
"Nothing?"
He nods. "Which is why I'm taking you to the mountains."
"But what should I do once I get there?"
"Just listen to the wind," he says. "That's what I always do."
I mull this over.
He gently lays a hand over mine. "There are a lot of things that aren't your fault.
Or mine, either. Not the fault of prophecies, or curses, or DNA, or absurdity. Not the
fault of Structuralism or the Third Industrial Revolution. We all die and disappear, but
that's because the mechanism of the world itself is built on destruction and loss. Our
lives are just shadows of that guiding principle. Say the wind blows. It can be a strong,
violent wind or a gentle breeze. But eventually every kind of wind dies out and
disappears. Wind doesn't have form. It's just a movement of air. You should listen
carefully, and then you'll understand the metaphor."
I squeeze his hand back. It's soft and warm. His smooth, sexless, delicately
graceful hand. "So you think it's better for me to be away from Miss Saeki for the time
being?"
"I do, Kafka. It's the best thing right now. We should let her be by herself. She's
bright, and tough. She's managed to put up with a terrible kind of loneliness for a long
time, a lot of painful memories. She can make whatever decisions she needs to make
alone."
"So I'm just a kid who's getting in the way."
"That's not what I mean," Oshima says softly. "That's not it at all. You did what
you had to do. What made sense to you, and to her. Leave the rest up to her. This might
sound cold, but there's nothing you can do for her now. You need to get into the
mountains and do your own thing. For you, the time is right."
"Do my own thing?"
"Just keep your ears open, Kafka," Oshima replied. "Just listen. Imagine you're a
clam."
Chapter 36
When he got back to the inn, Hoshino found Nakata--no surprise--still fast asleep. The
sack he'd put next to him with bread and orange juice was untouched. The old man
hadn't shifted an inch, probably hadn't woken up once the whole time. Hoshino counted
up the hours. Nakata had gone to sleep at two the previous afternoon, which meant he'd
been asleep for thirty solid hours. What day is it, anyway? Hoshino wondered. He was
completely losing track of time. He took his memo book out of his bag and checked.
Let's see, he told himself, we arrived in Tokushima on a Saturday on the bus from Kobe,
then Nakata slept till Monday. On Monday we left Tokushima for Takamatsu, Thursday
was all that ruckus with the stone and thunder, and that afternoon he went to sleep. So
skip ahead one night and that would make today... Friday. It's like the old guy came to
Shikoku to attend some Sleep Festival or something.
Like the night before, Hoshino took a bath, watched TV for a while, then climbed
into his futon. Nakata was still breathing peacefully, sound asleep. Whatever, Hoshino
thought. Just go with the flow. Let him sleep as much as he wants. No need to worry
about that. And he himself fell asleep, at ten-thirty.
At five the next morning the cell phone in his bag went off, jolting him awake.
Nakata was still out like a light.
Hoshino reached for the phone. "Hello."
"Mr. Hoshino!" A man's voice.
"Colonel Sanders?" Hoshino said, recognizing the voice.
"The very one. How's it hanging, sport?"
"Fine, I guess.... But how'd you get this number? I didn't give it to you, and the
phone's been turned off all this time so those clowns from work won't bother me. So
how could you call me? You're kind of freaking me out here."
"It's like I told you, I'm neither a god nor a Buddha, not a human being. I'm
something else again--a concept. So making your phone ring is a cinch. Piece of cake.
Whether it's turned on or not makes not one jot of difference, my friend. Don't let every
little thing get to you, okay? I could've run over and been right there beside you when
you woke up, but I figured that'd be a bit of a shock."
"You bet it would."
"Which explains the phone call. I'm a well-mannered person, after all."
"I appreciate it," Hoshino said. "So anyway, what're we supposed to do with the
stone? Nakata and I managed to flip it over so that entrance thing opened up. Lightning
was flashing like crazy outside, and the stone weighed a ton. Oh, that's right--I haven't
told you about Nakata yet. He's the guy I'm traveling with."
"I know all about Mr. Nakata," Colonel Sanders said. "No need to explain."
"You know about him?" Hoshino said. "Okay.... Anyhow, Nakata went into
hibernation after that, and the stone's still here. Don't you think we should get it back to
the shrine? We might be cursed for taking it without permission."
"You never give up, do you? How many times did I tell you there's no curse?"
Colonel Sanders said disgustedly. "Keep the stone there for the time being. You opened
it up, and eventually you'll have to close it again. Then you can take it back. But it's not
time for that yet. Get it? We okay here?"
"Yeah, I get it," Hoshino said. "Things that are open have to be shut. Things you
have, you gotta return the way they were. All right already! Anyhow, I've decided not to
think about things so much. I'll go along with whatever you want, no matter how crazy it
sounds. I had a kind of revelation last night. Taking crazy things seriously is--a serious
waste of time."
"A very wise conclusion. There's that saying, 'Pointless thinking is worse than no
thinking at all.'"
"I like that."
"Very suggestive, don't you think?"
"Have you heard the saying 'Sheepish butlers' surgical bottle battles'?"
"What on earth is that supposed to mean?"
"It's a tongue-twister. I made it up."
"Your point being?"
"No point, really. I just felt like saying it."
"Can the stupid comments, all right? I don't have much patience with inanity.
You'll drive me nuts if you keep it up."
"Sorry," Hoshino said. "But why'd you call me, anyway? You must have had a
reason to call so early."
"That's right. It completely slipped my mind," Colonel Sanders said. "Here's the
thing--I want you to leave that inn right this minute. No time to eat breakfast. Just wake
up Mr. Nakata, grab the stone, and get out. Get a cab, but don't have the inn call one for
you. Go out to the main street and flag one down. Then give the driver this address. Do
you have something to write with?"
"Yep, just a sec," Hoshino replied, grabbing a pen and his notebook from his bag.
"Broom and dustpan, check."
"Enough with the stupid jokes already!" Colonel Sanders yelled into the phone.
"I'm serious here. Not a minute to lose."
"Okay, okay. Go ahead."
Colonel Sanders recited the address and Hoshino wrote it down, repeating it to
make sure he got it right: "Apartment 308, Takamatsu Park Heights 16-15, 3-chome. Is
that it?"
"That's fine," Colonel Sanders replied. "You'll find the key under a black
umbrella stand at the front door. Unlock the door and go inside. You can stay there as
long as you like. There's a stock of food and things, so you won't have to go out for the
time being."
"That's your place?"
"It is indeed. I don't own it, though. It's rented. So make yourself at home. I got
the place for you two."
"Colonel?"
"Yeah?"
"You told me you're not a god, or a Buddha, or a human being, correct?"
"Correct."
"So I'm assuming you're not of this world."
"You got it."
"Then how could you rent an apartment? You're not human, so you don't have all
the papers and stuff you need, right? A family register, local registration, proof of
income, official stamp and seal and all that. If you don't have those, nobody's gonna rent
you a place. Did you cheat or something? Like change a leaf by magic into an official
stamp? Enough underhanded stuff's gone on already, I don't want to get mixed up in any
more."
"You just don't get it, do you?" Colonel Sanders said, clicking his tongue. "You
are one major dimwit. Is your brain made out of jello, you spineless twit? A leaf? What
do you think I am, one of those magical raccoons? I'm a concept, get it? Con-cept!
Concepts and raccoons aren't exactly the same, now are they? What a dumb thing to
say.... Do you really think I went over to the real estate agent's, filled out all the forms,
bargained with them to lower the rent? Ridiculous! I have a secretary take care of
temporal things. My secretary gets all the necessary documents and things together.
What do you expect?"
"Ah--so you have a secretary!"
"Damn right I do! Who do you think I am, anyway? You're way out of line. I'm a
busy man, so why shouldn't I have a secretary?"
"All right, all right--don't blow a gasket. I was just pulling your leg. Anyway,
why do we have to leave so fast? Can't we at least have a bite before we go? I'm starved,
and Mr. Nakata's out like a light. I couldn't wake him up no matter how hard I try."
"Listen up. This is no joke. The police are scouring the town for you. First thing
this morning, they've been making the rounds of hotels and inns, questioning everyone.
They've already got a description of both of you. So once they start nosing around it's
only a matter of time. The two of you stand out, let's face it. There's not a moment to
lose."
"The cops?" Hoshino shouted. "Gimme a break! We haven't done anything wrong.
Sure, I ripped off a few motorcycles back in high school. Just joyriding--it wasn't like I
was gonna sell them or anything. I always took them back. Never done anything illegal
since. Taking that stone from the shrine is about the worst thing I've done. And you told
me to."
"This has nothing to do with the stone," Colonel Sanders said flatly. "You're a
real dunce sometimes. Forget the stone. The police don't know anything about it, and
wouldn't give a damn if they did. They're not going to be up at the crack of dawn beating
down doors over some stone. We're talking about something much more serious."
"What do you mean?"
"The police are after Mr. Nakata because of it."
"I don't get it. He's the last person you'd ever imagine committing a crime. What
kind of crime? And how could he be involved?"
"No time to go into that now. You have to get him out of there. Everything
depends on you. Are we clear here?"
"I don't get it," Hoshino repeated, shaking his head. "It just doesn't make any
sense. So they're gonna tag me as an accomplice?"
"No, but I'm sure they'll question you. Time's a-wasting. Don't bother your head
over it now, just do as I say."
"Listen, you gotta understand one thing about me. I hate cops. They're worse than
the yakuza--worse than the SDF. They're awful, the things they do. They strut around
and love nothing better than tormenting the weak. I had plenty of run-ins with cops
when I was in high school, even after I started driving trucks, so the last thing I need is
to get into a fight with them. There's no way you can win, plus you can't shake 'em off
afterward. You know what I mean? God, how'd I get mixed up in all this? You see, what
I--"
The phone went dead.
"Jeez," Hoshino said. He sighed deeply and tossed the cell phone into his bag,
then tried to wake Nakata up.
"Hey, Mr. Nakata. Gramps. Fire! Flood! Earthquake! Revolution! Godzilla's on
the loose! Get up, already!"
It was some time before Nakata woke up. "I finished the beveling," he said. "The
rest I used as kindling. No, cats don't take baths. I'm the one who took the bath."
Obviously in his own little world.
Hoshino shook the old man's shoulder, pinched his nose, tugged at his ears, and
finally roused him to the land of the living.
"Is that you, Mr. Hoshino?" he asked.
"Yeah, it's me," Hoshino replied. "Sorry to wake you up."
"No problem. Nakata was going to get up soon anyway. Don't worry about it. I
finished with the kindling."
"Good. But something's come up--something not so good--and we have to get out
of here right now."
"Is it about Johnnie Walker?"
"That I don't know. I've got my sources, and they told me we better make
ourselves scarce. The cops are after us."
"Is that right?"
"That's what he said. But what happened with you and this Johnnie Walker guy?"
"Didn't Nakata already tell you?"
"No, you didn't."
"I feel like I did, though."
"No, you never told me the most important part."
"Well, what happened was--Nakata killed him."
"You gotta be kidding!"
"No, I'm not."
"Jeez Louise," Hoshino muttered.
Hoshino threw his belongings into his bag and wrapped the stone back up in its
cloth. It was the same weight as it had been originally. Not light, but at least he could
carry it. Nakata put his things in his canvas bag. Hoshino went to the front desk and told
them something had come up suddenly and they had to check out. Since he'd paid in
advance, it didn't take long. Nakata was still a bit unsteady on his feet but could walk.
"How long did I sleep?" he asked.
"Let me see," Hoshino said, doing the math. "About forty hours, give or take."
"I feel like I slept well."
"No wonder. If you don't feel refreshed after that kind of record-breaking sleep,
then sleep's kind of pointless, isn't it. Hey, you hungry?"
"Yes, I am. Very hungry."
"Can you hold off a while? First we have to get out of here, as soon as we can.
Then we'll eat."
"That's all right. I can wait."
Hoshino helped him out onto the main street and flagged down a cab. He told the
driver the address, and the driver nodded and sped off. The cab left the city, drove down
a main thoroughfare, and entered a suburb. The neighborhood was upscale and quiet,
quite a contrast from the noisy area near the station where they'd been staying. The ride
took about twenty-five minutes.
They stopped in front of a typical five-story neat-as-a-pin apartment building.
Takamatsu Park Heights, the sign said, though it was on a level expanse with no park in
sight. They rode the elevator up to the third floor, where Hoshino found the key, sure
enough, under the umbrella stand. The apartment was a standard two-bedroom place,
with a dinette kitchen, a living room, and a bathroom. The place was brand new, by the
looks of it, the furniture barely used. The living room contained a widescreen TV, a
small stereo, a sofa and a love seat, and each bedroom had a bed already made up. The
kitchen had the usual utensils, the shelves stocked with a passable set of plates, cups,
and bowls. There were smart-looking framed prints on the walls, and the whole place
looked like some model apartment a developer might come up with to show new clients.
"Not bad at all," Hoshino remarked. "Not much character, but at least it's clean."
"It's very pretty," Nakata added.
The large, off-white fridge was packed with food. Muttering to himself, Nakata
checked out everything, finally taking out some eggs, a green pepper, and butter. He
rinsed off the pepper, sliced it into thin strips, and sautéed it. Next he broke the eggs into
a bowl and whipped them up with chopsticks. He pulled out a frying pan and proceeded
to make two green-pepper omelettes with a practiced touch. He topped this off with
toast and took the whole meal over to the dining table, along with hot tea.
"You're quite the cook," Hoshino said. "I'm impressed."
"I've always lived alone, so I'm used to it."
"I live alone too, but don't ask me to cook anything, 'cause I stink at it."
"Nakata has a lot of free time and nothing else to do."
The two of them ate their toast and omelettes. They were still hungry, so Nakata
went back to the kitchen and sautéed some bacon and spinach, which they had with two
more slices of toast each. Starting to feel human again, they sank back on the sofa and
had a second cup of tea.
"So," Hoshino said, "you killed somebody, huh?"
"Yes, I did," Nakata answered, and gave a detailed account of how he stabbed
Johnnie Walker to death.
"Man alive," Hoshino said when he'd finished. "What a freaky story. The police
would never believe that, no matter how honest you are about it. I mean, I believe you,
but if you'd told me that a week ago I would have sent you packing."
"I don't understand it myself."
"At any rate, somebody's been murdered, and murder's not something you just
shrug off. The police aren't fooling around on this one, not if they've trailed you out here
to Shikoku."
"Nakata's sorry you had to get involved."
"Aren't you gonna give yourself up?"
"No, I'm not," Nakata said with uncharacteristic firmness. "I already tried to, but
right now I don't feel like doing that. There are some other things Nakata has to do.
Otherwise it's pointless for me to have come all this way."
"You have to close that entrance again."
"That's right. Things that are open have to be shut. Then I will be normal again.
But there are some things Nakata has to take care of first."
"Colonel Sanders, the guy who told me where the stone is," Hoshino said, "is
helping us lie low. But why's he doing this? Is there some connection between him and
Johnnie Walker?"
The more Hoshino tried to unravel it, though, the more confused he got. Better
not to try to make sense, he decided, of what basically doesn't make any. "Pointless
thinking is worse than no thinking at all," he concluded out loud, his arms crossed.
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata said.
"What's up?"
"I smell the sea."
Hoshino went to the window, opened it, went out on the narrow veranda, and
breathed in deeply. No sea smells that he could detect. Off in the distance, white
summer clouds floated above a pine forest. "I don't smell anything," he said.
Nakata came over beside him and started sniffing, his nose twitching like a
squirrel. "I can. The sea's right over there." He pointed to the forest.
"You have quite a nose there," Hoshino said. "I have a touch of a sinus problem
myself, so I'm always a bit stuffed up."
"Mr. Hoshino, why don't we walk over to the ocean?"
Hoshino thought about it. How could a little walk on the beach hurt anything?
"Okay, let's go."
"Nakata has to take a dump first, if it's all right."
"Take your time, we're in no rush."
While Nakata was in the toilet Hoshino walked around the apartment, checking it
out. Like the Colonel said, there was pretty much everything they needed. Shaving
cream in the bathroom, a couple of new toothbrushes, Q-tips, Band-Aids, nail clippers.
All the basics. Even an iron and ironing board. Very considerate of him, Hoshino
thought, though I imagine his secretary did all the work. They haven't forgotten a thing.
He opened the closet and found fresh underwear and clothes. No aloha shirts,
unfortunately, just some ordinary striped shirts and polo shirts, brand-new Tommy
Hilfigers. "And here I was thinking Colonel Sanders was pretty quick on the uptake,"
Hoshino complained to no one in particular. "He should've figured out I only wear aloha
shirts. If he went to all this trouble, he at least could've bought me one." He noticed the
shirt he had on was getting a bit rank, so took it off and pulled on a polo shirt. It was a
perfect fit.
They walked through the pines, up over a breakwater, and down to the beach. The
Inland Sea was calm. They sat down side by side on the sand, not speaking for a long
time, watching the waves rise up like sheets being fluffed into the air and then, with a
faint sound, break apart. Several small islands were visible offshore. Neither of them
had been to the sea very often in their lives, and they feasted their eyes on the scene.
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata said, breaking the silence.
"What is it?"
"The sea is a really nice thing, isn't it?"
"Yeah, it is. Makes you feel calm."
"Why is that?"
"Probably 'cause it's so big, with nothing on it," Hoshino said, pointing. "You
wouldn't feel so calm if there was a 7-Eleven over there, or a Seiyu department store,
would you? Or a pachinko place over there, or a Yoshikawa pawnshop? But as far as the
eye can see there's nothing--which is pretty darn nice."
"I suppose you're right," Nakata said, giving it some thought. "Mr. Hoshino?"
"What's up?"
"I have a question about something else."
"Shoot."
"What's at the bottom of the sea?"
"There's like another world down there, all kinds of fish, shellfish, seaweed, and
stuff. You've never been to an aquarium?"
"No, I've never been. The place where Nakata lived for a long time, Matsumoto,
didn't have one of those."
"No, I don't imagine it would," Hoshino said. "A town like that off in the hills--I
guess a mushroom museum or something would be about all you could expect. Anyhow,
there's all kinds of stuff at the bottom of the sea. The animals are different than us--they
take oxygen from the water and don't need air to breathe. There're some beautiful things
down there, some delicious things, plus some dangerous things. And things that'd totally
creep you out. If you've never seen it, it's hard to explain, but it's completely different
than what we're used to. Way down at the bottom it's totally dark and there are some of
the grossest creatures you've ever seen. What do you say when all this blows over we
check out an aquarium? They're kind of fun, and I haven't been to one in a long time. I'm
sure there's one around here."
"Yes, I'd love to go to a place like that."
"There's something I wanted to ask you."
"Yes?"
"The other day we lifted up that stone and opened the entrance, right?"
"Yes, you and I opened up the entrance. After that Nakata fell sound asleep."
"What I want to know is--did something take place because the entrance opened
up?"
Nakata gave a nod. "Yes. It did."
"But you still don't know what that is."
Nakata gave a decisive shake of his head. "No, Nakata doesn't know yet."
"So maybe it's happening someplace else, right this minute?"
"Yes, I think that's true. As you said, it's happening. And I'm waiting for it to
finish happening."
"And once whatever it is finishes taking place, everything will work itself out?"
Another definitive shake of the head. "That Nakata doesn't know. I'm doing what
I'm doing because I must. But I have no idea what will happen because of what I do. I'm
not so bright, so it's too hard for me to figure out. I don't know what's going to happen."
"At any rate, it's gonna take some time, right? For whatever this is to finish up
and some conclusion or something to happen?"
"That is correct."
"And while we're waiting we have to make sure the cops don't grab us. 'Cause
there's still stuff that needs doing?"
"Correct. I don't mind visiting the police. I'm ready to do whatever the Governor
tells me to do. But now is just not a good time to do that."
"You know what? If the cops heard your crazy story, they'd just blow it off and
make up some convenient confession, something anyone would believe. Like you were
robbing the house and you heard somebody, so you grabbed a knife from the kitchen
and stabbed him. They don't give a damn what the real facts are, or what's right.
Framing somebody just to jack up their arrest rate. They wouldn't bat an eye. Next thing
you know, you're thrown in jail or some maximum-security psycho ward. They'd lock
you up and throw away the key. You don't have enough money to hire some fancy
lawyer, so they'd stick you with some court-appointed bozo who couldn't care less, so
it's obvious how it'd end up."
"I'm afraid I don't understand all--"
"I'm just telling you what cops are like. Believe me, I know," Hoshino said. "So I
really don't want to take 'em on, okay? Cops and me just don't hit it off."
"I'm sorry to cause so many problems for you."
Hoshino sighed deeply. "As they say, though, 'Take the poison, take the plate.'"
"What does that mean?"
"If you're gonna take poison, you might as well eat the plate it came on."
"But if you eat a plate, you'll die. It's not good for your teeth, either. And it'll hurt
your throat."
"I'd have to agree," Hoshino said, puzzling over it. "Yeah--why do you have to
eat the plate?"
"I'm not so bright, so I really can't tell you. But aside from the poison, the plate's
way too hard."
"Um. You got that right. I'm starting to get confused myself. I never was one for
using my head, either. What I'm trying to say is, I've come this far so I'll stick with you
and make sure you escape. I can't believe you did anything bad, and I'm not going to just
abandon you here. I've got my honor to consider."
"Much obliged. Nakata can't thank you enough. I'll presume on you again, though,
and ask one more favor."
"Go for it."
"We'll need a car."
"Would a rental car be okay?"
"Nakata doesn't really know what that is, but any kind is fine. Big or small is all
right as long as it's a car."
"No problem. Now you're talking my specialty. I'll go pick one up in a while. So
we're gonna be heading out somewhere?"
"I think so. We probably will be headed out somewhere."
"You know something, Mr. Nakata?"
"Yes?"
"I never get bored when I'm with you. All kinds of off-the-wall things happen, but
that much I can say for sure--being with you's never boring."
"Thank you for saying that. I feel relieved to hear it. But Mr. Hoshino?"
"What's up?"
"I'm not really sure I understand what being bored means."
"You've never been bored before?"
"No, not even once."
"You know, I kind of had the feeling that might be the case."
Chapter 37
We stop at a town to have a bite to eat and stock up on food and mineral water at a
supermarket, then drive up the unpaved road through the hills and arrive at the cabin.
Inside, it's exactly as I left it a week ago. I open the window to air out the place, then
stow away the food.
"I'm going to take a nap before I head back," Oshima says, nearly covering his
face with his hands as he lets out a huge yawn. "I didn't sleep well last night."
He must really be exhausted, because as soon as he gets under the covers and
turns toward the wall, he's out. I make some coffee and pour it in a thermos for his ride
back, then head down to the brook with the aluminum pail to fill up on water. The forest
hasn't changed a bit--the same smell of grasses, birdcalls, babbling water in the brook,
the rush of wind through the trees, the same shadows of rustling leaves. The clouds
above me look really close. I feel nostalgic to see them again, for they've become a part
of me.
While Oshima sleeps I sit on the porch, sip tea, and read a book about Napoleon's
1812 invasion of Russia. Some 400,000 French soldiers lost their lives in that huge
country in this massive, pointless campaign. The battles themselves were awful, of
course, but there weren't enough doctors or medical supplies, so most of the severely
wounded soldiers were left to die in agony. More froze to death or died of starvation,
equally terrible ways to die. Seated there on the porch, sipping hot herb tea, birds
whistling all around me, I tried to picture the battlefield in Russia and these men
trudging through blizzards.
I get about a third of the way through the book and go check to see if Oshima's
okay. I know he's exhausted, but he's so quiet it's like he's not even there, and I'm a little
worried. But he's all right, wrapped in the covers, breathing quietly. I walk over next to
him and notice his shoulders rising and falling slightly. Standing there, I suddenly
remember that he's a woman. Most of the time I forget that, and think of him as a man.
Which is exactly what he wants, of course. But when he's sleeping, he looks like he's
gone back to being a woman.
I go out on the porch again and pick up where I left off in the book. Back to a
road outside Smolensk lined with frozen corpses.
Oshima sleeps for a couple of hours. After he wakes up he walks out on the porch
and looks at his car. The dusty, unpaved road has turned the green Miata almost white.
He gives a big stretch and sits down next to me. "It's the rainy season," he says, rubbing
his eyes, "but there's not much rain this year. If we don't get some soon, Takamatsu's
going to run out of water."
I venture a question: "Does Miss Saeki know where I am?"
He shakes his head. "No, I didn't tell her anything. She doesn't even know I have
a cabin up here. It's better to keep her in the dark, so she won't get mixed up in all this.
The less she knows, the less she needs to hide."
I nod. That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
"She's gotten mixed up in enough before," Oshima says. "She doesn't need this
now."
"I told her about my father dying recently," I tell him. "How somebody murdered
him. I left out the part about the police looking for me."
"She's pretty smart. Even if neither of us mentioned it, I get the feeling she's
figured out most of what's going on. So if I tell her tomorrow that you had something
you had to do and will be gone for a while, and tell her hi from you, I doubt she'll quiz
me about the details. Even if that's all I tell her, I know she'll just let it pass."
I nod.
"But you want to see her, don't you?"
I don't reply. I'm not sure how to express it, but the answer isn't hard to guess.
"I feel kind of sorry for you," Oshima says, "but like I said, I think you two
shouldn't see each other for a while."
"But I might never see her again."
"Perhaps," Oshima admits, after giving it some thought. "This is pretty obvious,
but until things happen, they haven't happened. And often things aren't what they seem."
"But how does Miss Saeki feel?"
Oshima narrows his eyes and looks at me. "About what?"
"I mean--if she knows she'll never see me again, does she feel the same about me
as I feel about her?"
Oshima grins. "Why are you asking me this?"
"I have no idea, which is probably why I'm asking you. Loving somebody,
wanting them more than anything--it's all a new experience. The same with having
somebody want me."
"I imagine you're confused and don't know what to do."
I nod. "Exactly."
"You don't know if she shares the same strong, pure feelings you have for her,"
Oshima comments.
I shake my head. "It hurts to think about it."
Oshima's silent for a time as he gazes out at the forest, eyes narrowed. Birds are
flitting from one branch to the next. His hands are clasped behind his head. "I know how
you feel," he finally says. "But this is something you have to figure out on your own.
Nobody can help you. That's what love's all about, Kafka. You're the one having those
wonderful feelings, but you have to go it alone as you wander through the dark. Your
mind and body have to bear it all. All by yourself."
It's after two when he gets ready to leave.
"If you divide up the food," he tells me, "it should last you a week. I'll be back by
then. If something comes up and I can't make it, I'll send my brother here with supplies.
He only lives about an hour away. I've told him about you being here. So no worries,
okay?"
"Okay."
"And like I told you before, be extra cautious if you go into the woods. If you get
lost, you'll never find your way out."
"I'll be careful."
"Just before World War II started, a large unit of Imperial troops carried out some
training exercises here, staging mock battles with the Soviet army in the Siberian forests.
Did I tell you this already?"
"No."
"Seems like I forgot the most important thing," Oshima says sheepishly, tapping
his temple.
"But this doesn't look like Siberian forests," I say.
"You're right. The trees here are all broadleaf types, the ones in those forests
would have to be evergreens, but I guess the military didn't worry about details. The
point was to march into the forest in full battle gear and conduct their war games."
He pours out a cup of the coffee I made from the thermos, spoons in a dollop of
sugar, and seems pleased with the results. "The military asked my great-grandfather to
let them use the mountain for their training, and he said sure, be my guest. Nobody else
was using it, after all. The unit marched up the road we drove here on, then went into the
forest. But when the exercises were finished and they took roll call, they discovered two
soldiers were missing. They'd just disappeared, full battle gear and all, during the
training, both brand-new draftees. The army conducted a huge search, but the two
soldiers never turned up." Oshima takes another sip of coffee. "To this day nobody
knows if they simply got lost or ran away. The forest around here is incredibly deep, and
there's hardly anything you could forage for food."
I nod.
"There's another world that parallels our own, and to a certain degree you're able
to step into that other world and come back safely. As long as you're careful. But go past
a certain point and you'll lose the path out. It's a labyrinth. Do you know where the idea
of a labyrinth first came from?"
I shake my head.
"It was the ancient Mesopotamians. They pulled out animal intestines--sometimes
human intestines, I expect--and used the shape to predict the future. They admired the
complex shape of intestines. So the prototype for labyrinths is, in a word, guts. Which
means that the principle for the labyrinth is inside you. And that correlates to the
labyrinth outside."
"Another metaphor," I comment.
"That's right. A reciprocal metaphor. Things outside you are projections of what's
inside you, and what's inside you is a projection of what's outside. So when you step into
the labyrinth outside you, at the same time you're stepping into the labyrinth inside.
Most definitely a risky business."
"Sort of like Hansel and Gretel."
"Right--just like them. The forest has set a trap, and no matter what you do, no
matter how careful you are, some sharp-eyed birds are going to eat up all your bread
crumbs."
"I promise I'll be careful," I tell him.
Oshima lowers the top on the Miata and climbs in. He puts on his sunglasses and
rests his hand on the gearshift. The forest echoes with the sound of that familiar roar. He
brushes back his hair, gives an abbreviated wave, and is gone. Dust swirls around where
he was, but the wind soon carries it away.
I go back inside the cabin. I lie down on the bed he'd been using and shut my eyes.
Come to think of it, I didn't get much sleep last night either. The pillow and covers still
show signs of Oshima having been there. Not him, really--more like his sleep. I sink
down in those signs. I've slept for half an hour when there's a loud thump outside the
cabin, like a tree branch snapped and tumbled to the ground. The sound jolts me awake.
I get up and walk out to the porch to have a look, but everything looks the same. Maybe
this is some mysterious sound the forest makes from time to time. Or maybe it was part
of a dream. I can't tell one from the other.
Until the sun sinks down in the west, I sit out on the porch, reading my book.
I make a simple meal and eat it in silence. After clearing away the dishes I sink
back in the old sofa and think about Miss Saeki.
"Like Oshima said, Miss Saeki's a smart person. Plus she has her own way of
doing things," the boy named Crow says. He's sitting next to me on the sofa, just like
when we were in my father's den. "She's very different from you," he tells me.
She's very different from you. She's overcome all kinds of obstacles--and not
what you'd call normal obstacles, either. She knows all kinds of things you're clueless
about, she's experienced a range of emotions you've never felt. The longer people live,
the more they learn to distinguish what's important from what's not. She's had to make a
lot of critical decisions, and has seen the results. Again, very different from you. You're
only a child who's lived in a narrow world and experienced very little. You've worked
hard to become stronger, and in some areas you actually have. That's a fact. But now
you find yourself in a new world, in a situation you've never been in before. It's all new
to you, so no wonder you feel confused.
No wonder you feel confused. One thing you don't understand very well is
whether women have sexual desire. Theoretically, of course they do. That much even
you know. But when it comes to how this desire comes about, what it's like--you're lost.
Your own sexual desire is a simple matter. But women's desire, especially Miss Saeki's,
is a total mystery. When she held you did she feel the same physical ecstasy? Or is it
something altogether different?
The more you think about it, the more you hate being fifteen. You feel hopeless.
If only you were twenty--no, even eighteen would be good, anything but fifteen--you
could understand better what her words and actions mean. Then you could respond the
right way. You're in the middle of something wonderful, something so tremendous you
may never experience it again. But you can't really understand how wonderful it is. That
makes you impatient. And that, in turn, leads to despair.
You try to picture what she's doing right now. It's Monday, and the library's
closed. What does she do on her days off? You imagine her alone in her apartment. She
does the laundry, cooks, cleans, goes out shopping--each scene flashes in your
imagination. The more you imagine, the harder it gets to sit still here. You want to turn
into a dauntless crow and fly out of this cabin, zoom out over these mountains, come to
rest outside her apartment, and gaze at her forever.
Perhaps she stops by the library and goes into your room. She knocks but there's
no answer. The door's unlocked. She discovers you're no longer there. The bed's made,
and all your things are gone. She wonders where you disappeared to. Perhaps she waits
a while for you to come back, sitting at the desk, head in hands, gazing at Kafka on the
Shore. Thinking of the past that's enveloped in that painting. But no matter how long she
waits, you don't return. She finally gives up and leaves. She walks over to her Golf in
the parking lot and starts the engine. The last thing you want is to let her leave like this.
You want to hold her, and know what each and every movement of her body means. But
you're not there. You're all alone, in a place cut off from everyone.
You climb into bed and turn off the light, hoping that she'll show up in this room.
It doesn't have to be the real Miss Saeki--that fifteen-year-old girl would be fine. It
doesn't matter what form she takes--a living spirit, an illusion--but you have to see her,
have to have her beside you. Your brain is so full of her it's ready to burst, your body
about to explode into pieces. Still, no matter how much you want her to be here, no
matter how long you wait, she never appears. All you hear is the faint rustle of wind
outside, birds softly cooing in the night. You hold your breath, staring off into the gloom.
You listen to the wind, trying to read something into it, straining to catch a hint of what
it might mean. But all that surrounds you are different shades of darkness. Finally, you
give up, close your eyes, and fall asleep.
Chapter 38
Hoshino looked up rental car agencies in the Yellow Pages, picked one at random, and
phoned them. "I just need a car for a couple of days," he explained, "so an ordinary
sedan's fine. Nothing too big, nothing that stands out."
"Maybe I shouldn't say this," the rental clerk said, "but since we only rent Mazdas,
we don't have a single car that stands out. So rest assured."
"Great."
"How about a Familia? A very reliable car, and I swear nobody will notice it at
all."
"Sounds good. The Familia it is." The rental agency was near the station, and
Hoshino told them he'd be over in an hour to pick up the car.
He took a taxi over, showed them his credit card and license, then rented the car
for two days. The white Familia parked in the lot was, as advertised, totally unobtrusive.
Turn away from it for a moment and every memory of what it looked like vanished. A
notable achievement in the field of anonymity.
Driving back to the apartment, Hoshino stopped at a bookstore and picked up
maps of Takamatsu city and the Shikoku highway system. He popped into a CD shop
nearby to see if they had a copy of Beethoven's Archduke Trio, but the little shop had
only a small classical section and one cheap, discount-bin version of the piece. Not the
Million-Dollar Trio, unfortunately, but Hoshino went ahead and paid his eight dollars.
Back in the apartment, a soothing fragrance filled the place. Nakata was bustling
around the kitchen preparing some steamed daikon and deep-fried flat tofu. "I had
nothing to do, so I made a few dishes," he explained.
"That's great," Hoshino said. "I've been eating out too much these days, and it'll
be nice to have a home-cooked meal for a change. Oh, hey--I got the car. It's parked
outside. Do you need it right away?"
"No, tomorrow would be fine. Nakata has to talk more with the stone today."
"Good idea. Talking things over is important. Whether you're talking with people,
or things, or whatever, it's always better to discuss things. You know, when I'm driving
trucks I often talk to the engine. You can hear all kinds of things if you listen closely."
"Nakata can't talk with engines, but it is important to discuss things."
"So how's it going with the stone? You able to communicate?"
"We're starting to."
"That's good. I was wondering--is the stone upset we brought it here?"
"No, not at all. As far as I can make out, the stone doesn't much care where it is."
"Whew--that's a relief," Hoshino sighed. "After all we've been through, if the
stone turns on us we're up a creek."
Hoshino spent the afternoon listening to his new CD. The performance wasn't as
spontaneous and memorable as the one he'd heard in the coffee shop. It was more
restrained and steady, but overall not so bad. As he lay back on the couch and listened,
the lovely melody got to him, the subtle convolutions of the fugue stirring up something
deep inside.
If I'd listened to this music a week ago, he told himself, I wouldn't have
understood the first thing about it--or even wanted to. But chance brought him to that
little coffee shop, where he sank back in that comfortable chair, enjoyed the coffee, and
listened to the music. And now look at me, he thought, I'm into Beethoven--can you
believe it? A pretty amazing development.
He played the piece over and over, testing out his newfound appreciation for
music. The CD contained a second Beethoven trio, the Ghost. Not such a bad piece, he
thought, though the Archduke was definitely his favorite. More depth, he concluded. All
the while, Nakata was off in a corner, facing the white stone and muttering.
Occasionally he'd nod or scratch his head. Two men off in their own little worlds.
"Does the music bother you?" Hoshino asked him.
"No, it's fine. Music doesn't bother me. To me it's like the wind."
"The wind, huh?"
At six Nakata made dinner--grilled salmon and a salad, plus a number of little
side dishes he'd concocted. Hoshino switched on the TV and watched the news to see if
there were any developments in the murder case. But there wasn't a word about it. Just
other news--a kidnapping of an infant girl, the usual Israeli and Palestinian reprisals, a
massive traffic accident on a highway in western Japan, a carjacking ring headed by
foreigners, some cabinet minister's stupid discriminatory remark, layoffs at companies in
the communication industry. Not a single upbeat story.
The two of them sat at the table and ate their dinner.
"This is really good," Hoshino said. "You're quite a cook."
"Much obliged. But you're the first person I've ever cooked for."
"You're telling me you never eat with friends or relatives or anybody?"
"Nakata knew many cats, but what we eat is very different."
"Well, yeah," Hoshino said. "But, anyway, this is delicious. Especially the
vegetables."
"I'm happy you like it. Nakata can't read, so sometimes I make some terrible
mistakes in the kitchen. So I always use the same ingredients and cook things the same
way. If I could read, I could make all kinds of different dishes."
"These are just fine."
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata said in a serious tone, sitting up straight.
"Yeah?"
"Not being able to read makes life tough."
"I imagine so," Hoshino said. "The commentary with this CD says Beethoven was
deaf. He was a famous composer, the top pianist in Europe when he was young. But
then one day, maybe because of illness, he started to go deaf. In the end he couldn't hear
a thing. Pretty rough to be a composer who can't hear. You know what I mean?"
"I think so."
"A deaf composer's like a cook who's lost his sense of taste. A frog that's lost its
webbed feet. A truck driver with his license revoked. That would throw anybody for a
loop, don't you think? But Beethoven didn't let it get to him. Sure, he must have been a
little depressed at first, but he didn't let misfortune get him down. It was like, Problem?
What problem? He composed more than ever and came up with better music than
anything he'd ever written. I really admire the guy. Like this Archduke Trio--he was
nearly deaf when he wrote it, can you believe it? What I'm trying to say is, it must be
tough on you not being able to read, but it's not the end of the world. You might not be
able to read, but there are things only you can do. That's what you gotta focus on--your
strengths. Like being able to talk with the stone."
"Yes, I am able to talk with it a little now. Nakata used to be able to talk with
cats."
"No one else can do that, right? Other people can read all the books they want and
they're still not gonna know how to talk to stones or cats."
"These days, though, Nakata's having a lot of dreams. In my dreams, for some
reason, I'm able to read. I'm not as dumb as I am now. I'm so happy and I go to the
library and read lots of books. And I'm thinking how wonderful it is to be able to read.
I'm reading one book after another, but then the light in the library goes out and it's dark.
Somebody turned off the light. I can't see a thing. I can't read any more books. And then
I wake up. Even if it's only in a dream, it's wonderful to be able to read."
"Interesting...," Hoshino said. "And here I'm able to read and hardly ever pick up
a book. The world's a mixed-up place, that's for sure."
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata asked.
"What's up?"
"What day of the week is it today?"
"It's Saturday."
"So tomorrow would be Sunday?"
"Normally, yeah."
"Would you drive me tomorrow morning?"
"Sure, but where do you want to go?"
"Nakata doesn't know. I'll think about it after I get in the car."
"Believe it or not," Hoshino said, "I had a feeling that's what you were going to
say."
Hoshino woke up the next morning just after seven. Nakata was already up
cooking breakfast. Hoshino went to the bathroom, scrubbed his face with cold water,
and shaved with an electric razor. They breakfasted on rice, miso soup with eggplant,
dried mackerel, and pickles. Hoshino had a second helping of rice.
While Nakata washed the dishes Hoshino watched the news on TV. This time
there was a short piece on the murder in Nakano. "Ten days have passed since the
incident, but the police still have no leads," the NHK announcer droned. An impressive
front gate of a house flashed on the screen, cordoned off, with a patrolman stationed
outside.
"The search continues for the missing fifteen-year-old son of the deceased,
though his whereabouts remain unknown. The search continues as well for a man in his
sixties who lives in the neighborhood and stopped by a police station right after the
incident to provide information regarding the murder. It remains unclear whether or not
there is a connection between these two people. Because the inside of the house was
undisturbed, the police believed that the crime was an act of personal revenge rather
than a robbery gone bad and are investigating Mr. Tamura's friends and acquaintances.
At the Tokyo National Modern Art Museum, where Mr. Tamura's artistic achievements
are being honored--"
"Hey, Gramps," Hoshino called out to Nakata in the kitchen.
"Yes? What is it?"
"Do you know the son of this guy that was murdered in Nakano? This fifteenyear-
old?"
"No, I don't. As I told you, all Nakata knows about is Johnnie Walker and his
dog."
"Yeah?" Hoshino replied. "The police are looking for that boy, too. An only child,
it sounds like, and there's no mention of his mom. I guess he ran away from home just
before the murder and he's still missing."
"Is that so...."
"A hard nut to crack, this murder," Hoshino said. "But the police are a pretty
tight-lipped bunch--they always know more than they let on. According to Colonel
Sanders, they're on to you, and know you're in Takamatsu. Plus they know some
handsome guy like me's with you. But they haven't leaked that to the media yet. They're
afraid if they let on we're here, we'll hightail it somewhere else. That's why they're
insisting they don't know where we are, publicly. A delightful bunch, cops."
At eight-thirty they went out to the rental car and climbed in. As he settled down
into the passenger seat, Nakata had his usual thermos of hot tea with him, as well as his
faithful shapeless hat, umbrella, and canvas bag. As they were leaving the apartment
Hoshino was about to put on his Chunichi Dragons cap when he glanced in the mirror
and was brought up short. The police must know the young guy they were looking for
would be decked out in a Dragons ball cap, green Ray-Bans, and an aloha shirt. There
couldn't be many people with Dragons caps on here in Takamatsu, and add on Ray-Bans
and the shirt and he'd stick out like a sore thumb. So that's why Colonel Sanders stocked
the place with inconspicuous navy blue polo shirts--he must've anticipated this. Nothing
gets by him, Hoshino thought, and tossed the sunglasses and cap aside.
"So, where to?" he asked.
"Anywhere is fine," Nakata replied. "Just circle around the city."
"You sure?"
"You can go wherever you like. I'll just enjoy the scenery."
"This is a first," Hoshino said. "I've done my share of driving--both in the Self-
Defense Force and with the truck company--and I'm a decent driver, if I say so myself.
But every time I get behind the wheel, I know where I'm going and beeline it right there.
That's just the way I am, I guess. Nobody's ever told me, You can go wherever you like-
-anywhere is fine. You're kind of baffling me here."
"Nakata is very sorry."
"It's okay--no need to apologize. I'll do my best," Hoshino said. He slipped the
CD of the Archduke Trio into the player. "I'll just drive all over the city while you enjoy
the view. Is that okay?"
"Yes, that would be fine."
"I'll stop the car when you find what you're looking for. And then the story will
develop in a new direction. Do I have that right?"
"Yes, that's what might happen," Nakata said.
"Let's hope so," Hoshino said, and unfolded the city map in his lap.
The two of them drove through the city, Hoshino marking each street on a block
to make sure they'd covered every one, then heading over to the next. They took an
occasional break so Nakata could enjoy a cup of tea, and Hoshino a Marlboro. The
Archduke Trio played over and over. At noon they stopped by a diner and had curry.
"But what the heck are you looking for?" Hoshino asked after they'd eaten.
"I don't know. But I think--"
"--that you'll know it when you see it. And until you see it, you won't know what
it is."
"Yes, that's correct."
Hoshino shook his head listlessly. "I knew what you were gonna say, but I just
had to be sure."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"It might take some time before I find it."
"That's okay. We'll do our best. The boat's left the dock, and we're stuck on it."
"Are we going to take a boat?" Nakata asked.
"No. No boats for the time being."
At three they went into a coffee shop, where Hoshino had a cup of coffee. Nakata
puzzled over his order, finally going with the iced milk. By this time Hoshino was
exhausted from all the driving and didn't feel like talking. He'd had his fill of Beethoven.
Driving around in a circle, getting nowhere, didn't suit him. He had to keep his speed
down and pay careful attention to what he was doing, and he was getting bored. An
occasional patrol car would pass by, and Hoshino did his best to avoid eye contact. He
also tried to avoid passing in front of any police boxes. The Mazda Familia might be just
about the most inconspicuous car on the road, but if the police spotted the same car
passing by a few times they might very well pull him over. He drove cautiously, making
absolutely sure he didn't rear-end anybody. An accident would put everything in
jeopardy.
As Hoshino drove around the city, checking the map as he went, Nakata sat
motionless, hands on the window, scanning the passing scenery, intently searching for
something, for all the world like a child or a well-behaved dog. They each concentrated
on their task until evening, and hardly a word passed between them.
"What are you searching for?" Out of desperation Hoshino started singing an
Inoue Yosui tune. He couldn't recall the rest of the lyrics, so he made them up as he
went along.
Haven't you found it yet?
The sun is soon setting...
And Hoshino's stomach is growling.
Driving round and round sets my head spinning.
They went back to the apartment at six.
"Let's continue tomorrow," Nakata said.
"We covered a lot of territory today. We can probably finish up the whole city
tomorrow," Hoshino said. "Hey--I got a question for you."
"And what might that be?"
"If you don't find what you're looking for in Takamatsu, then what?"
Nakata gave his head a good rub. "If we can't find it in Takamatsu, then we'll
have to look farther out."
"And if you still can't find it, then what're we supposed to do?"
"If that happens, then we have to search even more."
"We'll just make bigger and bigger circles and eventually we'll find it. Like the
saying goes, if a dog walks on, it's bound to bump into a stick."
"Yes, I think that will happen," Nakata said. "But Nakata doesn't understand.
Why does a dog have to hit a stick if it walks? If there's a stick in front of it, the dog can
go around it."
Hoshino puzzled this over. "Yeah, I guess you're right. I never thought about it
before...."
"It's very strange."
"Let's put the dog and the stick aside for a minute, okay?" Hoshino said. "That
only complicates things. What I want to know is how far are we going to search? If we
don't watch out, before we know it we'll wind up in another prefecture--Ehime or Kochi
or someplace. Summer will be over and it'll be fall by then."
"That may well be. But I have to find it, even if it's fall or winter. I know I can't
ask you to help me forever. Nakata will just walk alone and keep on searching."
"Let's not worry about that for right now," Hoshino stammered. "But can't the
stone be a pal and give us a hint or something? Even an approximate location would
help."
"Nakata's very sorry, but the stone doesn't say much."
"Yeah, it doesn't strike me as the talkative type," Hoshino said. "I don't imagine
it's much good at swimming, either. Whatever... We don't need to think about it now.
Let's get a good night's sleep and see what tomorrow brings."
The next day it was the same routine, with Hoshino this time circling the western
half of the city. By now his city map was full of yellow lines. Only the increased
number of yawns coming from the driver set this day apart from the previous one.
Nakata kept his face plastered against the window, intently studying the passing scenery,
and they hardly spoke. Whatever Nakata was looking for, he didn't find it.
"Would today be Monday?" Nakata asked.
"Yup. Yesterday was Sunday, so today's Monday," Hoshino said. Then, almost in
desperation, he made up a melody to some words that popped into his head: If today is
Monday, tomorrow must be Tuesday.
Ants are hard workers, swallows like to dress up.
The chimney's tall, the setting sun red.
"Mr. Hoshino," Nakata said after a while.
"Yeah?"
"You can look at ants working for a long time and never tire of it."
"I suppose you're right," Hoshino replied.
At noon they stopped by a restaurant specializing in eel and ordered the lunch
special, a bowl of rice topped with eel. At three they went to a coffee shop, where
Hoshino had coffee, Nakata kelp tea. By six p. m. the map was a mass of yellow marks,
the anonymous tires of the Familia having traversed every square inch of road in the city.
But still no luck.
What are you searching for? Hoshino sang again in a listless voice: Haven't you
found it yet? / We've gone everywhere in town. / My butt's aching, so can't we go home?
After he finished, he said, "We keep this up much longer, I'll turn into a regular
singer-songwriter," Hoshino said.
"What would that be?" Nakata asked.
"Never mind. Just a harmless joke."
Calling it a day, they left the city, got on the highway, and headed back to the
apartment. Lost in thought, Hoshino failed to turn left when he should. He tried to get
back on the highway, but the road curved off at a strange angle into a maze of one-way
streets and he was soon totally lost. Before he realized it they were in a residential area
they'd never seen before, an old-looking, elegant neighborhood with high walls
surrounding the homes. The road was strangely quiet, with not a soul in sight.
"I don't think we're too far from our apartment, but I have no idea where we are,"
Hoshino admitted. He parked the car in an empty lot, cut the engine, set the parking
brake, and spread out his map. He checked the name of the neighborhood and street
number on a nearby lightpole and looked for it on the map. Maybe his eyes were too
tired, but he couldn't find it.
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata asked.
"Yeah?"
"I'm sorry to bother you, but what does it say on that sign over there on that
gate?"
Hoshino looked up from his map and glanced where Nakata was pointing, down a
high wall with an old-fashioned gate, and next to it a large wooden sign. The black gate
was shut tight. "Komura Memorial Library," Hoshino read. "Huh, a library in this
deserted part of town? Doesn't even look like a library. More like an old mansion."
"Ko-mu-ra-Me-mori-al-Li-bra-ry?"
"You got it. Must be made to commemorate somebody named Komura. Who this
Komura guy is, though, I have no idea."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yup?"
"That's it."
"What do you mean--that?"
"The place Nakata's been searching for."
Hoshino looked up from his map again and gazed into Nakata's eyes. He frowned,
looked at the sign, and slowly read it again. He patted a Marlboro out of the box, put it
between his lips, and lit it with his plastic lighter. He slowly inhaled, then blew smoke
out the open window. "Are you sure?"
"Yes, this is it."
"Chance is a scary thing, isn't it?" Hoshino said.
"It certainly is," Nakata agreed.
Chapter 39
My second day on the mountain passes by leisurely, seamlessly. The only thing that
distinguishes one day from the next is the weather. If the weather was the same I
couldn't tell one day from another. Yesterday, today, tomorrow--they'd all blur into one.
Like an anchorless ship, time floats aimlessly across the broad sea.
I do the math and come up with today as Tuesday. The day Miss Saeki gives a
tour of the library, provided there are any people who want to take it. Just like the very
first day I came to the place.... Spike heels clicking on the stairs, she walks up to the
second floor, the sound reverberating through the stillness. Her glistening stockings,
bright white blouse, tiny pearl earrings, her Mont Blanc pen on top of her desk. Her
calm smile, tinged with the long shadow of resignation. All these details seem so far
away now--and no longer real.
Sitting on the sofa in the cabin, the odor of the faded fabric all around me,
memories of our lovemaking rise up in my head. Miss Saeki slowly removing her
clothes, getting into bed. My cock, not surprisingly, is rock hard as these thoughts filter
through my mind, but the tip's not red or sore anymore and doesn't sting.
Tiring of these sexual fantasies, I wander outside and go into my usual exercise
routine. I hang on to the porch railing and go through an ab workout. Then I do some
quick squats, followed by hard stretching. By this time I'm covered in sweat, so I wet
my towel in the stream and wipe myself off. The cold water helps calm my nerves. I sit
down on the porch and listen to Radiohead on my Walkman. Since I ran away I've been
listening to the same music over and over--Radiohead's Kid A, Prince's Very Best of.
Sometimes Coltrane's My Favorite Things.
At two p.m.--just when the library tour is starting--I head out into the forest. I
follow the same path, walk for a while, and arrive at the clearing. I sit down on the grass,
lean back against a tree trunk, and gaze up at the round opening of sky through the
branches. The edges of white summer clouds are visible. Up to this point, I'm safe. I can
find my way back to the cabin. A maze for beginners--if this were a video game I've
easily cleared Level 1. If I go any farther, though, I'll enter a more elaborate, more
challenging labyrinth. The path gets narrower and I'll get swallowed up by the sea of
ferns.
I ignore this and forge on ahead.
I want to see how deep this forest really is. I know it's dangerous, but I want to
see--and feel--what kind of danger lies ahead, how dangerous it really is. I have to.
Something's shoving me forward.
I cautiously go down a kind of path. The trees tower higher and higher, the air
growing denser by the minute. Up above, the mass of branches nearly blots out the sky.
All signs of summer have vanished, and it's like seasons never existed. Soon I no longer
know if what I'm following is a path or not. It looks like a path, is shaped like one--but
then again it doesn't, and isn't. In the middle of all this stuffy, overgrown greenery all
definitions start to get a bit fuzzy around the edges. What makes sense, and what doesn't,
it's all mixed up. Above me, a crow gives out a piercing caw that sounds like a warning,
it's so jarring. I stop and cautiously survey my surroundings. Without the proper
equipment it's too dangerous to go any farther. I have to turn around.
Which isn't easy. Like Napoleon's army on the retreat, going back is more
difficult than going forward, I discover. The path back is misleading, the dense
vegetation forming a dark wall in front of me. My own breathing sounds loud in my ears,
like a wind blowing at the edge of the world. A huge black butterfly about the size of
my palm appears from the shade of the trees and flutters into my line of sight, its shape
reminding me of that bloodstain on my T-shirt. It flies slowly across an open space, then
disappears among the trees again, and once it vanishes everything suddenly seems even
more oppressive, the air chillier. I'm seized by panic--not knowing how to get out of
here. The crow squawks out shrilly again--the same bird as before, sending the same
message. I stand still and look up, but can't see it. A breeze, a real one, blows up from
time to time, ominously rustling the dark leaves at my feet. I sense shadows racing past
behind me, but when I spin around they've hidden themselves.
Somehow I'm able to make it back to my safety zone--the little round clearing in
the forest. I plop down on the grass and take a deep breath. I look up at the patch of real
sky above me a couple of times, just to convince myself I've made it back to the world I
came from. Signs of summer--so precious now--surround me. Sunlight envelopes me
like a film, warming me up. But the fear I felt clings to me like a clump of unmelted
snow in the corner of a garden. My heart beats irregularly from time to time, and my
skin still has a slightly creepy feeling.
That night I lie there in the darkness, breathing quietly with my eyes wide open,
hoping to catch a figure appearing in the dark. Praying for it to appear, and not knowing
if prayers have any effect. Concentrating for all I'm worth, wanting badly for it to
happen. Hoping that wanting it so badly will make my wish come true.
But my wish doesn't come true, my desires are shot down. Like the night before,
Miss Saeki doesn't show up. Not the real Miss Saeki, not an illusion, not her as a fifteenyear-
old girl. The darkness remains just that--darkness. Right before I fall asleep I have
a massive erection, harder than any I've ever had, but I don't jack off. I've made up my
mind to hold the memory of making love with Miss Saeki untouched, at least for now.
Hands clenched tight, I fall asleep, hoping to dream of her.
Instead, I dream of Sakura.
Or is it a dream? It's all so vivid, clear, and consistent, but I don't know what else
to call it, so dream seems the best label. I'm in her apartment and she's asleep in bed. I'm
in my sleeping bag, just like that night I spent at her place. Time's been rewound, setting
me down at a turning point.
I wake up in the middle of the night dying of thirst, get out of my sleeping bag,
and drink some water. Glass after glass--five or six. My skin's covered with a sheen of
sweat, and the front of my boxers is tented in another huge erection. My cock's like
some animal with a mind of its own, operating on a different wavelength from the rest
of me. When I drink some water my cock automatically absorbs it. I can hear the faint
sound of it soaking up the water.
I put the glass next to the sink and lean back against the wall. I want to check the
time but can't find the clock. In this, the deepest hour of the night, even the clock's been
swallowed up in the depths. I'm standing beside Sakura's bed. Light from a streetlight
filters in through the curtain. She's facing away from me, fast asleep, her small, shapely
feet sticking out from under the thin covers. Behind me I hear a small, hard sound, like
someone's turned on a switch. Thick branches cut off my field of vision. There is no
season here. I make a decision and crawl in next to Sakura. The single bed creaks with
the extra weight. I breathe in the smell of the faintly sweaty back of her neck. Gently I
wrap my arms around her. She makes a small sound but continues to sleep. The crow
squawks loudly. I glance up but can't spot the bird. I can't even see the sky.
I pull up Sakura's T-shirt and fondle her soft breasts. I tweak her nipples like I'm
adjusting a radio dial. My rock-hard cock slaps against the back of her thigh, but she
doesn't make any noise and her breathing stays the same. She must be dreaming deeply,
I figure. Again the crow cries out, sending me a message, but I can't figure out what it's
trying to tell me.
Sakura's body is warm, and as sweaty as mine. I decide to pull her around toward
me, slowly pulling her closer so she's faceup. She exhales deeply but still doesn't show
any signs of waking. I rest my ear against her paper-flat stomach, trying to catch the
echoes of the dreams within that labyrinth.
My erection's not letting up, so rigid it looks like it'll last forever. I slip off her
small cotton panties, taking my time to get them down her legs and off. I rest my palm
against her pubic hair, gently letting my finger go in deeper. It's wet, invitingly wet. I
slowly move my finger. Still she doesn't wake up. Lost in her dream, she merely exhales
deeply again.
At the same time, in a hollow inside me, something struggles to break out of its
shell. Before I realize what's happening, there's a pair of eyes turned in on me, and I can
observe this whole scene. I don't yet know if this thing inside me is good or bad, but
whichever it is, I can't hold it back or stop it. It's still a slimy, faceless being, but it will
soon break free of its shell, show its face, and slough off its jelly-like coating. Then I'll
know what it really is. Now, though, it's just a formless sign. It's reaching out its handsthat-
won't-be-hands, breaking apart the shell at its softest point. And I can see each and
every one of its movements.
I make up my mind.
No, actually I haven't made up my mind about anything. Making up your mind
means you have a choice, and I don't. I strip off my boxers, releasing my cock. I hold
Sakura, spread her legs, and slip inside her. It's easy--she's so soft and I'm so hard. My
cock no longer hurts. In the past few days the tip's become even harder. Sakura's still
dreaming, and I bury myself inside her dream.
Suddenly she snaps awake and realizes what's going on.
"Kafka, what are you doing?!"
"It would seem that I'm inside you," I reply.
"But why?" she asks in a dry, raspy voice. "Didn't I tell you that's off limits?"
"I can't help it."
"Stop already. Get it out of me."
"I can't," I say, shaking my head emphatically.
"Listen to me. First of all, I've got a steady boyfriend, okay? And second, you've
come into my dream without permission. That's not right."
"I know."
"It's still not too late. You're inside me, but you haven't started moving, you
haven't come yet. It's just quietly inside me, like it's thinking about something. Am I
right?"
I nod.
"Take it out," she admonishes me. "And let's pretend this never happened. I can
forget it, and so should you. I'm your sister, and you're my brother. Even if we're not
blood related, we're most definitely brother and sister. You understand what I'm saying?
We're part of a family. We shouldn't be doing this."
"It's too late," I tell her.
"Why?"
"Because I decided it is."
"Because you decided it is," says the boy named Crow.
You don't want to be at the mercy of things outside you anymore, or thrown into
confusion by things you can't control. You've already murdered your father and violated
your mother--and now here you are inside your sister. If there's a curse in all this, you
mean to grab it by the horns and fulfill the program that's been laid out for you. Lift the
burden from your shoulders and live--not caught up in someone else's schemes, but as
you. That's what you want.
She covers her face with her hands and cries a little. You feel sorry for her, but
there's no way you're going to leave her body. Your cock swells up inside her, gets even
harder, like it's set down roots.
"I understand," she says. "I won't say any more. But I want you to remember
something: You're raping me. I like you, but this isn't how I want it to be. We might
never see each other again, no matter how much we want to meet later on. Are you okay
with that?"
You don't respond. Your mind's switched off. You draw her close to you and start
to move your hips. Carefully, cautiously, in the end violently. You try to remember the
shapes of the trees to help you get back, but they all look the same and are soon
swallowed up in the anonymous sea. Sakura closes her eyes and gives herself up to the
motion. She doesn't say a word or resist. Her face is expressionless, turned away from
you. But you feel the pleasure rising up in her like an extension of yourself. Now you
understand it. The entwined trees stand like a dark wall blocking your view. The bird no
longer sends its message. And you come.
I come.
And I wake up. I'm in bed, alone. It's the middle of the night. The darkness is as
deep as it can be, all clocks lost within. I get out of bed, strip off my underpants, go over
to the kitchen, and rinse the semen off them. Gooey, white, and heavy, like some
illegitimate child born of the darkness. I gulp down glass after glass of water, but
nothing slakes my thirst. I feel so alone I can't stand it. In the darkness, in the middle of
the night, surrounded by a deep forest, I couldn't be more alone. There are no seasons
here, no light. I walk back to the bed, sit down, and breathe a huge sigh. The darkness
wraps itself around me.
The thing inside you has revealed itself. The shell is gone, completely shattered,
nowhere to be seen, and it's there, a dark shadow, resting. Your hands are sticky with
something--human blood, by the look of it. You hold them out in front of you, but
there's not enough light to see. It's far too dark. Both inside, and out.
Chapter 40
Next to the sign that read Komura Memorial Library was an information placard
informing them that the library's hours were eleven to five, except for Monday, when it
was closed, that admission was free, and that tours were conducted every Tuesday at
two p. m. Hoshino read all this aloud for Nakata.
"Today's Monday, so it's closed," Hoshino said. He glanced at his watch. "Not
that it matters much, since it's way past their closing time anyway. Same difference."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"This place doesn't look at all like the library we went to before," Nakata said.
"That was a large public library and this one's private. So the scale's different."
"When you say a private library, what does that mean?"
"It means some man of property who likes books puts up a building and makes all
the books he's collected available to the public. This guy must have really been
something. You can tell from the gate he had to be pretty impressive."
"What is a man of property?"
"A rich person."
"What's the difference between the two?"
Hoshino tilted his head in thought. "I don't know. Seems to me a man of
property's more cultured than just a regular rich guy."
"Cultured?"
"Anybody who has money is rich. You or me, as long as we had money, we'd be
rich. But becoming a man of property isn't so easy. It takes time."
"It's difficult to become one?"
"Yeah, it is. Not that we need to worry about it. I don't see either of us becoming
rich, let alone cultured."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"Since they're closed on Monday, if we come here tomorrow morning at eleven
they should be open, right?" Nakata asked.
"I suppose so. Tomorrow's Tuesday."
"Will Nakata be able to go inside the library?"
"The sign says it's open to everybody. Of course you can."
"Even if I can't read?"
"No problem," Hoshino said. "They don't quiz people at the entrance about
whether they can read or not."
"I want to go inside, then."
"We'll come back tomorrow, first thing, and go in together," Hoshino said. "I got
a question for you first, though. This is the place you were looking for, right? And the
thing you're looking for's inside?"
Nakata removed his cap and rubbed his close-cropped hair vigorously. "Yes. I
think it's here."
"So we can give up our search?"
"That's right. The search is over."
"Thank God," Hoshino said. "I was starting to wonder if we'd really be driving
around till fall."
The two of them drove back to Colonel Sanders's apartment, slept soundly, and
set off at eleven the next morning for the library. It was only a twenty-minute walk from
the apartment, so they decided to stroll over. Hoshino had already returned the rental car.
The gate of the library was open wide when they arrived. It looked like it was
going to be a hot, humid day, and someone had splashed water on the pavement to keep
the dust down. Past the gate was a neat, well-kept garden.
"Mr. Nakata?" Hoshino said in front of the gate.
"Yes, how can I help you?"
"What do we do after we go inside the library? I'm always afraid you're all of a
sudden gonna come up with some off-the-wall idea, so I'd like to know about it ahead of
time. I have to prepare myself."
Nakata gave it some thought. "Nakata has no idea what to do once we get in. This
is a library, though, so I thought we might start by reading books. I'll find a photo
collection or book of paintings, and you can pick whatever you'd like to read."
"Gotcha. Starting off by reading--that makes sense."
"Then after a while we can think about what to do next."
"Okay," Hoshino said. "We'll think about what comes later--later. Sounds like a
plan."
They walked through the beautiful garden and into the antique-looking entrance.
There was a reception area right inside, with a handsome, slim young man seated behind
the counter. He had on a white button-down shirt and small glasses. Long, fine hair hung
over his forehead. Someone you might expect to see in a black-and-white Truffaut film,
Hoshino thought.
The young man looked up at them and beamed.
"Good morning," Hoshino said cheerfully.
"Good morning," the young man replied. "Welcome to the library."
"We'd, uh--like to read some books."
"Of course," Oshima nodded. "Feel free to read whatever you like. We're open to
the public. The stacks are completely open, so take any books you'd like to read. You
can look books up in our card catalog or online. And if you have any questions, don't
hesitate to ask. I'd be more than happy to help."
"That's very kind of you."
"Is there a particular field or book you're looking for?"
Hoshino shook his head. "Not really. Actually we're more interested in the library
itself than books. We happened to pass by and thought the place looked interesting. It's a
beautiful building."
Oshima gave a graceful smile and picked up a neatly sharpened pencil. "A lot of
people just stop by like that."
"Glad to hear it," Hoshino said.
"If you have the time, you might consider the short tour of the place that takes
place at two. We have one every Tuesday, as long as there are people who'd like to join
in. The head of the library explains the background of the library. And today just
happens to be Tuesday."
"That sounds like fun. Hey, what d'ya say, Mr. Nakata?"
All the time Hoshino and Oshima had been talking at the counter, Nakata stood
off to one side, cap in hand, gazing vacantly at his surroundings. At the sound of his
name, he came out of his daze. "Yes, how can I help you?"
"They have a tour of the library at two. You want to go on it?"
"Yes, Mr. Hoshino, thank you. Nakata would like to."
Oshima watched this exchange with great interest. Messrs. Hoshino and Nakata--
what sort of relationship did they have to each other? They didn't seem like relatives. A
strange combo, these two--with a vast difference in age and appearance. What could
they possibly have in common? And this Mr. Nakata, the older one, had an odd way of
speaking. There was something about him Oshima couldn't quite pin down. Not
anything bad, though. "Have you traveled far to get here?" he asked.
"We came from Nagoya," Hoshino said hurriedly before Nakata could open his
mouth. If he started in about being from Nakano, things could get a little sticky. The TV
news had already put out the word that an old man like Nakata was connected with the
murder there. Fortunately, though, as far as Hoshino knew, Nakata's photograph hadn't
been made public.
"That's quite a journey," Oshima commented.
"Yes, we crossed a bridge to get here," Nakata said. "A long, wonderful bridge."
"It is pretty long, isn't it?" Oshima said. "Though I've never been over it myself."
"Nakata had never seen such a long bridge in all his life."
"It took a lot of time and a tremendous amount of money to build it," Oshima
went on. "According to the newspaper, each year the public corporation that operates the
bridge and the highway over it is a billion dollars in the red. Our taxes make up the
shortfall."
"Nakata has no idea how much a billion is."
"I don't either, to tell you the truth," Oshima said. "After a certain point amounts
like that aren't real anymore. Anyway, it's a huge amount of money."
"Thanks so much," Hoshino butted in. There was no telling what Nakata might
say next, and he had to nip that possibility in the bud. "We should be here at two for the
tour, right?"
"Yes, two would be fine," Oshima said. "The head librarian will be happy to
show you around then."
"We'll be reading until then," Hoshino said.
Twirling his pencil in his hand, Oshima watched the retreating figures and then
went back to work.
They picked some books from the stacks, Hoshino going for Beethoven and His
Generation. Nakata picked out some photo collections and placed them on the table.
Next, much like a dog might, he circled the room, carefully checking out everything,
touching things, sniffing their odor, stopping at select spots to stare fixedly. They had
the reading room to themselves until past twelve, so no one else noticed the old man's
eccentric behavior.
"Hey, Gramps?" Hoshino whispered.
"Yes, how may I help you?"
"This is kind of sudden, but I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention to anyone
that you're from Nakano."
"Why is that?"
"It's a long story, just take my word for it. If people find out that's where you're
from, it might cause them some trouble."
"I understand," Nakata said, nodding deeply. "It's not good to trouble others.
Nakata won't say a word about being from Nakano."
"That'd be great," Hoshino said. "Oh--did you find whatever it is you're looking
for?"
"No, nothing so far."
"But this is definitely the place?"
Nakata nodded. "It is. Last night I had a good talk with the stone before I went to
bed. I'm sure this is the place."
"Thank God."
Hoshino nodded and returned to his biography. Beethoven, he learned, was a
proud man who believed absolutely in his own abilities and never bothered to flatter the
nobility. Believing that art itself, and the proper expression of emotions, was the most
sublime thing in the world, he thought political power and wealth served only one
purpose: to make art possible. When Haydn boarded with a noble family, as he did most
of his professional life, he had to eat with the servants. Musicians of Haydn's generation
were considered employees. (The unaffected and good-natured Haydn, though, much
preferred this arrangement to the stiff and formal meals put on by the nobility.)
Beethoven, in contrast, was enraged by any such contemptuous treatment, on
occasion smashing things against the wall in anger. He insisted that as far as meals went
he be treated with no less respect than the nobility he ostensibly served. He often flew
off the handle, and once angry was hard to calm down. On top of this were radical
political ideas that he made no attempt to hide. As his hearing deteriorated, these
tendencies became even more pronounced. As he aged his music also became both more
expansive and more densely inward looking. Only Beethoven could have balanced these
two contrasting tendencies. But the extraordinary effort this required had a progressively
deleterious effect on his life, for all humans have physical and emotional limits, and by
this time the composer had more than reached his.
Geniuses like that don't have it easy, Hoshino thought, impressed, and laid down
his book. He remembered the bronze bust of a scowling Beethoven in the music room of
his school, but until now he'd had no idea of the hardships the man had endured. No
wonder the guy looked so sour. I'm never gonna be a genius, that's for sure, Hoshino
thought.
He looked over at Nakata, who was deep into a photo collection of traditional
folk furniture, and working an imaginary chisel and plane. These photos must've made
him unconsciously feel like he was back at his old job. And Nakata--who knows? He
might become a great person someday, Hoshino thought. Most people can't do the kinds
of things he does. The old codger's definitely in a class all his own.
After twelve, two other readers, middle-aged women, came into the reading room,
so Hoshino and Nakata used the opportunity to take a breather outside. Hoshino had
brought some bread along for their lunch, while Nakata was lugging around his usual
thermos of hot tea. Hoshino first asked Oshima at the counter whether it was all right to
eat on the library grounds.
"Of course," Oshima replied. "It's nice to sit on the veranda overlooking the
garden. Afterward, feel free to come in for a cup of coffee. I've already made some, so
help yourself."
"Thanks," Hoshino said. "This is quite a homey place you have here."
Oshima smiled and brushed back his hair. "It is a little different from your normal
library. Homey is a good way to describe it. What we're trying to create is sort of an
intimate space where people can relax and enjoy reading."
Hoshino found Oshima an appealing young man. Intelligent, well groomed,
obviously from a good family. And quite kind. He's got to be gay, right? Not that
Hoshino cared. To each his own, was his thinking. Some men talk with stones, and some
sleep with other men. Go figure.
After lunch, Hoshino stood up, stretched his whole body, then went back to the
reception area to take Oshima up on his offer of a cup of coffee. Since Nakata didn't
drink coffee, he stayed on the veranda sipping his tea and gazing at the birds flitting
around the garden.
"So, did you find anything interesting to read?" Oshima asked Hoshino.
"Yeah, I've been reading a biography of Beethoven," Hoshino replied. "I like it.
His life really gives you a lot to think about."
Oshima nodded. "He went through a lot--to put it mildly."
"He did have a tough time," Hoshino said, "but I think it was mainly his fault. I
mean, he was so self-centered and uncooperative. All he thought about was himself and
his music, and he didn't mind sacrificing whatever he had to for it. He must've been
tough to get along with. Hey, Ludwig, gimme a break! That's what I would have said if I
knew him. No wonder his nephew went off his rocker. But I have to admit his music is
wonderful. It really gets to you. It's a strange thing."
"Absolutely," Oshima agreed.
"But why did he have to live such a hard, wild life? He would've been better off
with a more normal type of life."
Oshima twirled the pencil around in his fingers. "I see your point, but by
Beethoven's time people thought it was important to express the ego. Earlier, when there
was an absolute monarchy, this would've been considered improper, socially deviant
behavior and suppressed quite severely. Once the bourgeoisie came to power in the
nineteenth century, however, that suppression came to an end and the individual ego
was liberated to express itself. Freedom and the emancipation of the ego were
synonymous. And art, music in particular, was at the forefront of all this. Those who
came after Beethoven and lived under his shadow, so to speak--Berlioz, Wagner, Liszt,
Schumann--all lived eccentric, stormy lives. Eccentricity was seen as almost the ideal
lifestyle. The age of Romanticism, they called it. Though I'm sure living like that was
pretty hard on them at times. So, you like Beethoven's music?"
"I can't really say if I do or not. I haven't heard that much," Hoshino admitted.
"Hardly any at all, actually. I just kind of like that piece called the Archduke Trio."
"That is nice, yes."
"The Million-Dollar Trio's great," Hoshino added.
"I prefer the Czech group, the Suk Trio, myself," Oshima said. "They have a
beautiful balance. You feel like you can smell the wind wafting over a green meadow.
But I do know the Million-Dollar Trio version--Rubinstein, Heifetz, and Feuermann. It's
an elegant performance."
"Um, Mr.--Oshima?" Hoshino asked, looking at the nameplate on the counter.
"You know a lot about music, I can tell."
Oshima smiled. "Not a lot. I just enjoy listening to it."
"Do you think music has the power to change people? Like you listen to a piece
and go through some major change inside?"
Oshima nodded. "Sure, that can happen. We have an experience--like a chemical
reaction--that transforms something inside us. When we examine ourselves later on, we
discover that all the standards we've lived by have shot up another notch and the world's
opened up in unexpected ways. Yes, I've had that experience. Not often, but it has
happened. It's like falling in love."
Hoshino had never fallen head over heels in love himself, but he went ahead and
nodded anyway. "That's gotta be a very important thing, right?" he said. "For our lives?"
"It is," Oshima answered. "Without those peak experiences our lives would be
pretty dull and flat. Berlioz put it this way: A life without once reading Hamlet is like a
life spent in a coal mine."
"A coal mine?"
"Just typical nineteenth-century hyperbole."
"Well, thanks for the coffee," Hoshino said. "I'm happy we could talk."
Oshima gave him a big grin in reply.
Hoshino and Nakata read books until two, Nakata going through his carpenter's
motions as he leafed through the collection of furniture photographs. Besides the
middle-aged ladies, three other readers had joined them after lunch. But only Hoshino
and Nakata asked to join the tour of the library.
"You don't mind if it's just the two of us?" Hoshino asked. "I feel bad you have to
go to all this trouble just for us."
"No trouble at all," Oshima said. "The head librarian is happy to conduct the tour,
even for one person."
At two on the dot a good-looking middle-aged woman came down the stairs.
Back held straight, she had an impressive walk. She wore a dark blue suit with severe
lines, black high heels, a thin silver necklace at her wide, open neckline, her hair
gathered in the back. Nothing extraneous, altogether a highly refined, tasteful look.
"Hello. My name is Miss Saeki. I'm the head librarian here," the woman said, and
smiled calmly.
"I'm Hoshino."
"I'm Nakata, and I'm from Nakano," the old man said, hiking hat in hand.
"We're glad you've come to visit us from so far away," Miss Saeki said.
A chill ran down Hoshino's spine at Nakata's words, but Miss Saeki didn't look
suspicious.
Nakata was typically oblivious."Yes, I crossed over a very big bridge," he said.
"This is a wonderful building," Hoshino interjected, trying to cut off any talk of
bridges.
"The building was built in the early Meiji period as the library and guesthouse of
the Komura family," Miss Saeki began. "Many literati visited and lodged here. It's been
designated a historical site by the city."
"Litter oddy?" Nakata asked.
Miss Saeki smiled. "Artists--poets, novelists, and so forth. In the past men of
property in various localities helped support artists. Art was different back then, and
wasn't viewed as something one should make a living at. The Komuras were men of
property in this region who sponsored culture and the arts. This library was built, and is
operated, to pass down that legacy to future generations."
"Man of property--Nakata knows what that means," Nakata said. "It takes a long
time to become one."
Smiling, Miss Saeki nodded. "You're quite right, it does. No matter how much
money you accumulate, you can't buy time. Well, we'll begin our tour on the second
floor."
They toured the rooms upstairs one by one. Miss Saeki gave her usual talk about
the various literati who had stayed there, and showed the two men the calligraphy and
paintings these artists had left behind. During the tour Nakata seemed to turn a deaf ear
to what she was saying, instead curiously examining each and every item. In the study
Miss Saeki used as her office, a fountain pen was sitting on the desk. It was up to
Hoshino to follow along and make all the appropriate noises. All the while he was on
pins and needles, worried the old man would suddenly do something bizarre. But all
Nakata did was continue to scrutinize the items they passed by. Miss Saeki didn't seem
to care what Nakata did. Smiling all the while, she briskly showed them around.
Hoshino was impressed by how calm and collected she was.
The tour ended in twenty minutes, and the two men thanked their guide. Miss
Saeki's smile never failed the entire time. The more Hoshino watched her, though, the
more confused he grew. She smiles and looks at us, he told himself, but she doesn't see
anything. She's looking at us, but she's seeing something else. Though all the time she
was giving the tour, even if her mind was elsewhere, she was perfectly polite and kind.
Whenever he asked a question, she gave a kind, easy-to-follow response. It's not like
she's doing this against her will or anything. A part of her enjoys doing a meticulous job.
But her heart isn't in it.
The two men returned to the reading room and settled down on the sofa with their
books. But as he turned the pages, Hoshino couldn't get Miss Saeki out of his mind.
There was something very unusual about that beautiful woman, but he couldn't quite put
his finger on it. He gave up and went back to reading.
At three o'clock, totally without warning, Nakata stood up. His movements were
uncharacteristically decisive. He held his hat firmly in his hand.
"Hey, what's up? Where are you going?" Hoshino whispered.
But there was no response. Lips set in a determined look, Nakata was already
hurrying toward the main entrance, his belongings left behind on the floor.
Hoshino shut his book and stood up. Something was definitely wrong. "Hey, wait
up!" he called. Realizing the old man wasn't about to, he scrambled after him. The other
readers looked up and watched him leave.
Before he got to the entrance, Nakata turned left and without hesitating started up
to the second floor. A NO VISITORS ALLOWED BEYOND THIS POINT sign at the
foot of the stairs didn't deter him, since he couldn't read. His worn tennis shoes squeaked
on the floorboards as he climbed up the stairs.
"Excuse me," Oshima said, leaning over the counter to call out to the retreating
figure. "That area is closed now."
Nakata didn't seem to hear him.
Hoshino ran up the stairs after him. "Gramps. It's closed. You can't go there."
Oshima came out from behind the counter and followed them up the stairs.
Undaunted, Nakata strode down the corridor and into the study. The door was
open. Miss Saeki, her back to the window, was sitting at the desk reading a book. She
heard the footsteps and looked up. When he got to the desk, Nakata stood there looking
down at her face. Neither one of them said a word. A moment later Hoshino arrived,
soon followed by Oshima.
"There you are," Hoshino said, tapping the old man on the shoulder. "You're not
supposed to be here. It's off-limits. We have to leave, okay?"
"Nakata has something to say," Nakata said to Miss Saeki.
"And what would that be?" Miss Saeki asked quietly.
"I want to talk about the stone. The entrance stone."
For a while Miss Saeki silently studied the old man's face. Her eyes shone with a
noncommittal light. She blinked a few times, then silently closed her book. She rested
both hands on the desk and looked up again at Nakata. She looked undecided about how
to proceed, but then gave a small nod.
She looked over at Hoshino, then at Oshima. "Would you mind leaving us alone
for a while?" she said to Oshima. "We're going to have a talk. Please close the door on
your way out."
Oshima hesitated, then nodded. He gently took Hoshino's arm, led him out to the
corridor, and shut the door.
"Are you sure it's okay?" Hoshino asked.
"Miss Saeki knows what she's doing," Oshima said as he escorted Hoshino back
down the stairs. "If she says it's all right, it's all right. No need to worry about her. So,
Mr. Hoshino, why don't we go have a cup of coffee while we're waiting?"
"Well, when it comes to Mr. Nakata, worrying's a total waste of time," Hoshino
said, shaking his head. "That I can guarantee."
Chapter 41
When I go into the woods this time I've outfitted myself with everything I might need:
compass, knife, canteen, some emergency food, work gloves, a can of yellow spray
paint, and the small hatchet I'd used before. I stuff all this into a small nylon daypack
that was also in the tool shed, and head off into the forest. I'm wearing a long-sleeved
shirt, a towel wrapped around my neck, and the cap Oshima gave me, and I've sprayed
insect repellent over all the exposed parts of my body. The sky's overcast, and it's hot
and sticky like it could rain any minute, so I throw a poncho into the pack just in case. A
flock of birds screech at each other as they cut across the low, leaden sky.
I make it easily to that round clearing in the forest. Checking my compass to
make sure I'm generally heading north, I step deeper into the woods. This time I spray
yellow markings on tree trunks to mark the route. Unlike Hansel and Gretel's bread
crumbs, spray paint's safe from hungry birds.
I'm better prepared, so I'm not as afraid. I'm nervous, sure, but my heart's not
pounding. Curiosity's what's leading me on. I want to know what lies down this path.
Even if there's nothing there, I want to know that. I have to know. Memorizing the
scenery as I pass by, I move steadily forward, step by careful step.
Occasionally there's some weird sound. A thud like something hitting the ground,
a creak like floorboards groaning under weight, and others I can't even describe. I have
no idea what these mean, since there's no knowing what they are. Sometimes they sound
far away, sometimes right near by--the sense of distance expanding and contracting.
Bird wings echo above me, sounding louder, more exaggerated, than they should. Every
time I hear this I stop and listen intently, holding my breath, waiting for something to
happen. Nothing does, and I walk on.
Besides these sudden, unexpected sounds, everything else is still. There's no wind,
no rustle of leaves in the treetops, just my own footsteps as I push through the brush.
When I step on a fallen branch, the snap reverberates through the air.
I grasp the hatchet, which I'd sharpened, and it feels rough in my gloveless hands.
Up to this point it hasn't come in handy, but its heft is comforting, and makes me feel
protected. But from what? There aren't any bears or wolves in this forest. A few
poisonous snakes, perhaps. The most dangerous creature here would have to be me. So
maybe I'm just scared of my own shadow.
Still, as I walk along I get the feeling something, somewhere, is watching me,
listening to me, holding its breath, blending into the background, watching my every
move. Somewhere far off, something's listening to all the sounds I make, trying to guess
where I'm headed and why. I try not to think about it. The more you think about
illusions, the more they'll swell up and take on form. And no longer be an illusion.
I try whistling to fill in the silence. The soprano sax from Coltrane's "My Favorite
Things," though of course my dubious whistling doesn't come anywhere near the
complex, lightning-quick original. I just add bits so what I hear in my head
approximates the sound. Better than nothing, I figure. I glance at my watch--it's tenthirty.
Oshima must be getting the library ready to open. Today would be... Wednesday.
I picture him sprinkling water in the garden, wiping off the desks with a cloth, boiling
water and brewing up some coffee. All the tasks I normally take care of. But now I'm
here, deep in the forest, heading even deeper. Nobody has any idea I'm here. The only
ones who do are me, and them.
I continue down the path. Calling it a path, though, isn't quite right. It's more like
some natural kind of channel that water's carved out over time. When there's a
downpour in the forest, rushing water gouges out the dirt, sweeping the grasses before it,
exposing the roots of trees. When it hits a boulder it makes a detour around it. Once the
rain lets up you're left with a dry riverbed that's something like a path. This pseudo-path
is covered with ferns and green grass, and if you don't pay attention you'll lose it entirely.
It gets steep every once in a while, and I scramble up by grabbing hold of tree trunks.
Somewhere along the line Coltrane's soprano sax runs out of steam. Now it's
McCoy Tyner's piano solo I hear, the left hand carving out a repetitious rhythm and the
right layering on thick, forbidding chords. Like some mythic scene, the music portrays
somebody's--a nameless, faceless somebody's--dim past, all the details laid out as clearly
as entrails being dragged out of the darkness. Or at least that's how it sounds to me. The
patient, repeating music ever so slowly breaks apart the real, rearranging the pieces. It
has a hypnotic, menacing smell, just like the forest.
I hike along, spraying marks on the trees as I go, sometimes turning to make sure
these yellow marks are still visible. It's okay--the marks that lead me home are like an
uneven line of buoys in the sea. Just to be doubly sure, every once in a while I hack out
a notch in a tree trunk. My little hatchet isn't very sharp, so I pick out the thinner, softerlooking
trunks to hack. The trees receive these blows in silence.
Huge black mosquitoes buzz me like reconnaissance patrols, aiming for the
exposed skin around my eyes. When I hear their buzz I brush them away or squash them.
Whenever I smush one it makes a squish, already bloated with blood it's sucked out of
me. It feels itchy only later. I wipe the blood off my hands on the towel around my neck.
The army marching through these woods, if it was summer, must have had the
same problems with mosquitoes. Full battle gear--how much would that have weighed?
Those old-style rifles like a clump of iron, ammunition belt, bayonet, steel helmet, a
couple of grenades, food and rations, of course, entrenching tools to dig foxholes, mess
kit... All that gear must add up to well over forty pounds. Damn heavy, and a lot more
than my little daypack. I have the distinct feeling I'm going to bump into those soldiers
around the next bend, even though they disappeared here more than sixty years ago.
I remember Napoleon's troops marching into Russia in the summer of 1812. They
must have swatted away their share of mosquitoes, too, on that long road to Moscow. Of
course mosquitoes weren't the only problem. They had to struggle to survive all kinds of
other things--hunger, thirst, muddy roads, infectious disease, sweltering heat, Cossack
commandos attacking their thin supply lines, lack of medical supplies, not to mention
huge battles with the regular Russian army. When the French forces finally straggled
into a deserted Moscow, their number had been reduced from 500,000 to a mere
100,000.
I stop and take a swig of water from my canteen. My watch shows exactly eleven
o'clock. The library is just opening up. Oshima's unlocking the door, taking his usual
seat behind the counter, a stack of long, neatly sharpened pencils on the desk. He picks
one up and twirls it, gently pushing the eraser end against his temple. I can see it all
clearly. But that place is so far away.
I've never had periods, says Oshima. I do anal sex and have never used my vagina
for sex. My clitoris is sensitive but my breasts aren't.
I remember Oshima asleep in the bed in the cabin, his face to the wall. And the
signs he/she left behind. Cloaked in those signs, I went to sleep in the same bed.
I give up thinking about it anymore. Instead I think about war. The Napoleonic
Wars, the war the Japanese soldiers had to go off and fight. I feel the heft of the hatchet
in my hands. That pale, sharp blade glints and I have to turn my eyes away from it. Why
do people wage war? Why do hundreds of thousands, even millions of people group
together and try to annihilate each other? Do people start wars out of anger? Or fear? Or
are anger and fear just two aspects of the same spirit?
I hack another notch in a tree with my hatchet. The tree cries out silently,
bleeding invisible blood. I keep on trudging. Coltrane picks up his soprano sax again.
Once more the repetition breaks apart the real, rearranging the pieces.
Before long my mind wanders into the realm of dreams. They come back so
quietly. I'm holding Sakura. She's in my arms, and I'm inside her. I don't want to be at
the mercy of things outside me anymore, thrown into confusion by things I can't control.
I've already murdered my father and violated my mother--and now here I am inside my
sister. If there's a curse in all this, I mean to grab it by the horns and fulfill the program
that's been laid out for me. Lift the burden from my shoulders and live--not caught up in
someone else's schemes, but as me. That's what I really want. And I come inside her.
"Even if it's in a dream, you shouldn't have done that," the boy named Crow calls
out. He's right behind me, walking in the forest. "I tried my best to stop you. I wanted
you to understand. You heard, but you didn't listen. You just forged on ahead."
I don't respond or turn around, just silently keep on trudging.
"You thought that's how you could overcome the curse, right? But was it?" Crow
asks.
But was it? You killed the person who's your father, violated your mother, and
now your sister. You thought that would put an end to the curse your father laid on you,
so you did everything that was prophesied about you. But nothing's really over. You
didn't overcome anything. That curse is branded on your soul even deeper than before.
You should realize that by now. That curse is part of your DNA. You breathe out the
curse, the wind carries it to the four corners of the Earth, but the dark confusion inside
you remains. Your fear, anger, unease--nothing's disappeared. They're all still inside you,
still torturing you.
"Listen up--there's no war that will end all wars," Crow tells me. "War breeds war.
Lapping up the blood shed by violence, feeding on wounded flesh. War is a perfect, selfcontained
being. You need to know that."
"Sakura--my sister," I say. I shouldn't have raped her. Even if it was in a dream.
"What should I do?" I ask, staring at the ground in front of me.
"You have to overcome the fear and anger inside you," the boy named Crow says.
"Let a bright light shine in and melt the coldness in your heart. That's what being tough
is all about. Do that and you really will be the toughest fifteen-year-old on the planet.
You following me? There's still time. You can still get your self back. Use your head.
Think about what you've got to do. You're no dunce. You should be able to figure it
out."
"Did I really murder my father?" I ask.
No reply. I swing around, but the boy named Crow is gone and the silence
swallows my question.
Alone in such a deep forest, the person called me feels empty, horribly empty.
Oshima once used the term hollow men. Well, that's exactly what I've become. There's a
void inside me, a blank that's slowly expanding, devouring what's left of who I am. I can
hear it happening. I'm totally lost, my identity dying. There's no direction where I am, no
sky, no ground. I think of Miss Saeki, of Sakura, of Oshima. But I'm light-years away
from them. It's like I'm looking through the wrong end of a pair of binoculars, and no
matter how far I stretch out my hand, I can't touch them. I'm all alone in the middle of a
dim maze. Listen to the wind, Oshima told me. I listen, but no wind's blowing. Even the
boy named Crow has vanished.
Use your head. Think about what you've got to do.
But I can't think anymore. No matter how much I try, I wind up at a dead end in
the maze. What is it inside me that makes up me? Is this what's supposed to stand up to
the void?
If only I could wipe out this me who's here, right here and right now. I seriously
consider it. In this thick wall of trees, on this path that's not a path, if I stopped breathing,
my consciousness would silently be buried in the darkness, every last drop of my dark
violent blood dripping out, my DNA rotting among the weeds. Then my battle would be
over. Otherwise, I'll eternally be murdering my father, violating my mother, violating
my sister, lashing out at the world forever. I close my eyes and try to find my center.
The darkness that covers it is rough and jagged. There's a break in the dark clouds, like
looking out the window to see the leaves of the dogwood gleaming like a thousand
blades in the moonlight.
I feel something rearranging itself under my skin, and there's a tinkling sound in
my head. I open my eyes and take a deep breath. I throw away the can of spray paint, the
hatchet, the compass. From far away I hear them all clatter to the ground. I feel lighter. I
slip the daypack off my shoulders and toss it aside. My sense of touch seems suddenly
acute. The air around me's grown more transparent. My sense of the forest has grown
more intense. Coltrane's labyrinthine solo plays on in my ears, never ending.
Thinking it over, I reach into the daypack and take out the hunting knife and stuff
it in my pocket. The razor-sharp knife I stole from my father's desk. If need be, I could
use it to slash my wrists and let every drop of blood inside me gush out onto the ground.
That would destroy the device.
I head off into the heart of the forest, a hollow man, a void that devours all that's
substantial. There is nothing left to fear. Not a thing.
And I head off into the heart of the forest.
Chapter 42
Once the two of them were alone, Miss Saeki offered Nakata a chair. He thought about
it for a moment before sitting down. They sat there for a time without speaking, eyeing
each other across the desk. Nakata placed his hiking hat on his lap and gave his short
hair a good rub with his hand. Miss Saeki rested both hands on the desktop, quietly
watching him go through his routine.
"Unless I'm mistaken, I think I've been waiting for you to come," she said.
"I believe that's true," Nakata replied. "But it took some time for Nakata to get
here. I hope I didn't make you wait too long. I did my best to get here as quickly as I
could."
Miss Saeki shook her head. "No, it's perfectly all right. If you'd come any earlier,
or any later, I would've been even more at a loss, I suppose. For me, right now is the
perfect time."
"Mr. Hoshino was very kind to me and helped me out a lot. If I had to do it alone
it would've taken even longer. Nakata can't read, after all."
"Mr. Hoshino is your friend, isn't he?"
"Yes," Nakata replied, and nodded. "I think he is. But to tell the truth, I'm not all
too sure about that. Besides cats, I've never had what you would call a friend in my life."
"I haven't had any friends either, for quite some time," Miss Saeki said. "Other
than in memories."
"Miss Saeki?"
"Yes?" she replied.
"Actually, I don't have any memories either. I'm dumb, you see, so could you tell
me what memories are like?"
Miss Saeki stared at her hands on the desk, then looked up at Nakata again.
"Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart."
Nakata shook his head. "That's a tough one. Nakata still doesn't understand. The
only thing I understand is the present."
"I'm the exact opposite," Miss Saeki said.
A deep silence settled over the room.
Nakata was the one who broke it, lightly clearing his throat. "Miss Saeki?"
"Yes?"
"You know about the entrance stone, don't you?"
"Yes, I do," she said. She brushed the Mont Blanc pen on the desk with her
fingers. "I happened to come across it a long time ago. Perhaps it would've been better if
I'd never known about it. But I had no choice in the matter."
"Nakata opened it again a few days ago. The afternoon when there was lightning.
Lots of lightning falling all over town. Mr. Hoshino helped me. I couldn't have done it
myself. Do you know the day I'm talking about?"
Miss Saeki nodded. "Yes, I remember."
"I opened it because I had to."
"I know. You did that so things would be restored to the way they should be."
It was Nakata's turn to nod. "Exactly."
"And you had the right to do it."
"Nakata doesn't know about that. In any case, it wasn't something I chose. I have
to tell you this--I murdered someone in Nakano. I didn't want to kill anybody, but
Johnnie Walker was in charge and I took the place of the fifteen-year-old boy who
should've been there, and I murdered someone. Nakata had to do it."
Miss Saeki closed her eyes, then opened them and looked him in the face. "Did
all that happen because I opened the entrance stone a long time ago? Does that still have
an effect even now, distorting things?"
Nakata shook his head. "Miss Saeki?"
"Yes?" she said.
"Nakata doesn't know about that. My role is to restore what's here now to the way
it should be. That's why I left Nakano, went across a huge bridge, and came to Shikoku.
And as I'm sure you're aware, you can't stay here anymore."
Miss Saeki smiled. "I know," she said. "It's what I've been hoping for, Mr. Nakata,
for a long time. Something I longed for in the past, what I'm longing for right now. No
matter how I tried, though, I couldn't grasp it. I simply had to sit and wait for that time--
now, in other words--to come. It wasn't always easy, but suffering is something I've had
to accept."
"Miss Saeki," Nakata said, "I only have half a shadow. The same as you."
"I know."
"Nakata lost it during that war. I don't know why that had to happen, and why it
had to be me.... At any rate, a long time has passed since then, and it's nearly time for us
to leave here."
"I understand."
"Nakata's lived a long time, but as I said, I don't have any memories. So this
'suffering' you talked about I don't rightly understand. But what I think is--no matter
how much suffering you went through, you never wanted to let go of those memories."
"That's true," Miss Saeki said. "It hurt more and more to hold on to them, but I
never wanted to let them go, as long as I was alive. It was the only reason I had to go on
living, the only thing that proved I was alive."
Nakata nodded silently.
"Living longer than I should have has only ruined many people and many things,"
she went on. "Just recently I had a sexual relationship with that fifteen-year-old boy you
mentioned. In that room I became a fifteen-year-old girl again, and made love to him. I
don't know if that was the right thing to do or not, but I couldn't help it. But those
actions must surely have caused something else to be ruined. That's my only regret."
"Nakata doesn't know about sexual desire. Just like I don't have memories, I don't
have any desire. So I don't understand the difference between right or wrong sexual
desire. But if something did happen, it happened. Whether it's right or wrong, I accept
everything that happens, and that's how I became the person I am now."
"Mr. Nakata?"
"Yes?"
"I have a favor to ask." Miss Saeki picked up the bag at her feet, took out a small
key and unlocked a desk drawer, then pulled out some thick file folders and laid them on
top of the desk.
"Ever since I came back to this town," she said, "I've been writing this. A record
of my life. I was born nearby and fell deeply in love with a boy who lived in this house.
I couldn't have loved him more, and he was deeply in love with me. We lived in a
perfect circle, where everything inside was complete. Of course that couldn't go on
forever. We grew up, and times changed. Parts of the circle fell apart, the outside world
came rushing into our private paradise, and things inside tried to get out. All quite
natural, I suppose, yet at the time I couldn't accept it. And that's why I opened up the
entrance stone--to prevent our perfect, private world from collapsing. I can't remember
now how I managed to do it, but I decided I had to open the stone no matter what--so I
wouldn't lose him, so things from the outside wouldn't destroy our world. I didn't
understand at the time what it would mean. And of course I received my punishment."
She stopped speaking here, picked up the fountain pen, and closed her eyes. "My
life ended at age twenty. Since then it's been merely a series of endless reminiscences, a
dark, winding corridor leading nowhere. Nevertheless, I had to live it, surviving each
empty day, seeing each day off still empty. During those days I made a lot of mistakes.
No, that's not correct--sometimes I feel that all I did was make mistakes. I felt like I was
living at the bottom of a deep well, completely shut up inside myself, cursing my fate,
hating everything outside. Occasionally I ventured outside myself, putting on a good
show of being alive. Accepting whatever came along, numbly slipping through life. I
slept around a lot, at one point even living in a sort of marriage, but it was all pointless.
Everything passed away in an instant, with nothing left behind except the scars of things
I injured and despised."
She laid her hands on top of the three files on her desk. "All the details are in here.
I wrote this to put it all in order, to make sure one more time about the life I lived. I have
only myself to blame, but it's a gut-wrenching process. And I've finally finished it. I've
written everything I need to write. I don't need this anymore, and I don't want anybody
else to read it. If someone else happened to see it, it might cause harm all over again. So
I want it all burned up, every last page, so nothing's left. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like
you to take care of it. You're the only person I can depend on, Mr. Nakata. I'm sorry to
bother you with this, but could you do it for me?"
"Nakata understands," he said, nodding seriously. "If that's what you'd like, Miss
Saeki, I'll be happy to burn it all up for you. You can rest assured."
"Thank you," Miss Saeki said.
"Writing things was important, wasn't it?" Nakata asked.
"Yes, it was. The process of writing was important. Even though the finished
product is completely meaningless."
"I can't read or write, so I can't write things down. Nakata's just like a cat."
"Mr. Nakata?"
"How can I help you?"
"I feel like I've known you for ages," Miss Saeki said. "Weren't you in that
painting? A figure in the sea in the background? White pants legs rolled up, dipping
your feet in the water?"
Nakata silently stood up and came over to stand in front of Miss Saeki. He laid
his hard, sunburned hands on top of hers on the files. And as if listening carefully to
something, he felt the warmth there filter from her hand to his. "Miss Saeki?"
"Yes?"
"I think I understand a little now."
"About what?"
"What memories are. I can feel them, through your hands."
She smiled. "I'm glad."
Nakata kept his hands on top of hers for a long while. Eventually Miss Saeki
closed her eyes, quietly giving herself over to memories. There was no more pain there,
for someone had siphoned it off forever. The circle was once again complete. She opens
the door of a faraway room and finds two beautiful chords, in the shape of lizards,
asleep on the wall. She gently touches them and can feel their peaceful sleep. A gentle
wind is blowing, rustling the old curtain from time to time. A significant rustling, like
some parable. She's wearing a long blue dress. A dress she wore somewhere a long time
ago. Its hem swishes faintly as she walks. The shore is visible outside the window. And
you can hear the sound of waves, and someone's voice. There's a hint of the sea in the
breeze. And it's summer. Always it's summer. Small white clouds are etched against the
azure sky.
Nakata carried the three thick files downstairs. Oshima was at the counter talking
with one of the patrons. When he saw Nakata, he grinned. Nakata gave a polite bow in
return, and Oshima went back to his conversation. Hoshino was in the reading room all
the while, deep in a book.
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata said.
Hoshino laid his book down and looked up. "Hey, that took a while. You all
finished?"
"Yes, Nakata's all finished here. If it's all right with you, I was thinking we can
leave pretty soon."
"Fine by me. I'm nearly finished with this book. Beethoven just died, and I'm at
the part about the funeral. Man, what a funeral! Twenty-five thousand Viennese joined
the procession, and they closed all the schools for the day."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah, what's up?"
"I have one more favor to ask of you."
"Shoot."
"I need to burn this somewhere."
Hoshino looked at the files the old man was carrying. "Hmm, that's a lot of stuff.
We can't just burn it anywhere. We'd need a dry riverbed or someplace."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"Let's go find one then."
"Maybe this is a stupid question, but is that really so important? Can't we just toss
it somewhere?"
"Yes, it's very important and we have to burn it all up. It has to turn into smoke
and rise into the sky. And we have to watch it, to make sure it all burns up."
Hoshino stood up and stretched. "Okay, let's find a big riverbed. I have no idea
where, but I'm sure Shikoku's gotta have at least one--if we look long enough."
The afternoon was busier than it had ever been. Lots of people came to use the
library, several with detailed, specialized questions. It was all Oshima could do to
respond, and to run around collecting materials that had been requested. Several items
he had to locate on the computer. Normally he'd ask Miss Saeki to help out, but today it
didn't look like he'd be able to. Various tasks took him away from his desk and he didn't
even notice when Nakata left. When things settled down for a moment he looked around,
but the strange pair was nowhere to be seen. Oshima walked upstairs to Miss Saeki's
study. Strangely, the door was shut. He knocked twice and waited, but there was no
response. He knocked again. "Miss Saeki?" he said from outside the door. "Are you all
right?"
He softly turned the knob. The door was unlocked. Oshima opened it a crack and
peeked inside. And saw Miss Saeki facedown on the desk. Her hair had tumbled forward,
hiding her face. He didn't know what to do. Maybe she was just tired and had fallen
asleep. But he'd never once seen her take a nap. She wasn't the type to doze off at work.
He walked into the room and went over to the desk. He leaned over and whispered her
name in her ear, but got no response. He touched her shoulder, then held her wrist and
pressed his finger against it. There was no pulse. Her skin retained a faint warmth, but it
was already fading away.
He lifted her hair and checked her face. Both eyes were slightly open. She looked
like she was having a pleasant dream, but she wasn't. She was dead. A faint trace of a
smile was still on her lips. Even in death she was graceful and dignified, Oshima
thought. He let her hair fall back and picked up the phone on the desk.
He'd resigned himself to the fact that it was only a matter of time before this day
came. But now that it had, and he was alone in this quiet room with a dead Miss Saeki,
he was lost. He felt as if his heart had dried up. I needed her, he thought. I needed
someone like her to fill the void inside me. But I wasn't able to fill the void inside her.
Until the bitter end, the emptiness inside her was hers alone.
Somebody was calling out his name from downstairs. He felt like he'd heard that
voice. He'd left the door wide open and could hear the sounds of people bustling around.
A phone rang on the first floor. He ignored it all. He sat down and gazed at Miss Saeki.
You want to call my name, he thought, go right ahead. You want to call on the phone--
be my guest. Finally he heard an ambulance siren that seemed to be getting closer. In a
few moments people will be rushing upstairs to take her away--forever. He raised his
left arm and glanced at his watch. It was 4:35 .4:35 on a Tuesday afternoon. I have to
remember this time, he thought. I have to remember this day, this afternoon, forever.
"Kafka Tamura," he whispered, staring at the wall, "I have to tell you what
happened. If you don't already know."
Chapter 43
With all my baggage gone I can travel light now, forging on deeper into the forest. I
focus totally on moving forward. No need to mark any more trees, no need to remember
the path back. I don't even look at my surroundings. The scenery's always the same, so
what's the point? A canopy of trees towering above thick ferns, vines trailing down,
gnarled roots, lumps of decaying leaves, the dry, sloughed-off skins of various bugs.
Hard, sticky spiderwebs. And endless branches--a regular tree branch universe.
Menacing branches, branches fighting for space, cleverly hidden branches, twisted,
crooked branches, contemplative branches, dried-up, dying branches--the same scenery
repeated again and again. Though with each repetition the forest grows a bit deeper.
Mouth tightly shut, I continue down what passes for a path. It's running uphill,
but not so steeply, at least for now. Not the kind of slope that's going to get me out of
breath. Sometimes the path threatens to get lost in a sea of ferns or thorny bushes, but as
long as I push on ahead the pseudo-path pops up again. The forest doesn't scare me
anymore. It has its own rules and patterns, and once you stop being afraid you're aware
of them. Once I grasp these repetitions, I make them a part of me.
I'm empty-handed now. The can of yellow spray paint, the little hatchet--they're
history. The daypack's gone as well. No canteen, no food. Not even the compass. One by
one I left these behind. Doing this gives a visible message to the forest: I'm not afraid
anymore. That's why I chose to be totally defenseless. Minus my hard shell, just flesh
and bones, I head for the core of the labyrinth, giving myself up to the void.
The music that had been playing in my head has vanished, leaving behind some
faint white noise like a taut white sheet on a huge bed. I touch that sheet, tracing it with
my fingertips. The white goes on forever. Sweat beads up under my arms. Sometimes I
can catch a glimpse of the sky through the treetops. It's covered with an even, unbroken
layer of gray clouds, but it doesn't look like it's going to rain. The clouds are still, the
whole scene unchanging. Birds in the high branches call out clipped, meaningful
greetings to each other. Insects buzz prophetically among the weeds.
I think about my deserted house back in Nogata. Most likely it's all shut up now.
Fine by me. Let the bloodstains be. What do I care? I'm never going back there. Even
before that bloody incident took place, that house was a place where lots of things had
died. Check that--were murdered.
Sometimes from above me, sometimes from below, the forest tries to threaten me.
Blowing a chill breath on my neck, stinging like needles with a thousand eyes. Trying
anything to drive this intruder away. But I gradually get better at letting these threats
pass me by. This forest is basically a part of me, isn't it? This thought takes hold at a
certain point. The journey I'm taking is inside me. Just like blood travels down veins,
what I'm seeing is my inner self, and what seems threatening is just the echo of the fear
in my own heart. The spiderweb stretched taut there is the spiderweb inside me. The
birds calling out overhead are birds I've fostered in my mind. These images spring up in
my mind and take root.
Like I'm being shoved from behind by some huge heartbeat, I continue on and on
through the forest. The path leads to a special place, a light source that spins out the dark,
the place where soundless echoes come from. I need to see with my own eyes what's
there. I'm carrying an important, sealed, personal letter, a secret message to myself.
A question. Why didn't she love me? Don't I deserve to have my mother love me?
For years that question's been a white-hot flame burning my heart, eating away at
my soul. There had to be something fundamentally wrong with me that made my mother
not love me. Was there something inherently polluted about me? Was I born just so
everyone could turn their faces away from me?
My mother didn't even hold me close when she left. She turned her face away and
left home with my sister without saying a word. She disappeared like quiet smoke. And
now that face is gone forever.
The birds screech above me again, and I look up at the sky. Nothing there but that
flat, expressionless layer of gray clouds. No wind at all. I trudge along. I'm walking by
the shores of consciousness. Waves of consciousness roll in, roll out, leave some writing,
and just as quickly new waves roll in and erase it. I try to quickly read what's written
there, between one wave and the next, but it's hard. Before I can read it the next wave's
washed it away. All that's left are puzzling fragments.
My mind wanders back to my house on the day my mother left, taking my sister
with her. I'm sitting alone on the porch, staring out at the garden. It's twilight, in early
summer, and the trees cast long shadows. I'm alone in the house. I don't know why, but I
already knew I was abandoned. I understood even then how this would change my
world forever. Nobody told me this--I just knew it. The house is empty, deserted, an
abandoned lookout post on some far-off frontier. I'm watching the sun setting in the
west, shadows slowly stealing over the world. In a world of time, nothing can go back to
the way it was. The shadows' feelers steadily advance, eroding away one point after
another along the ground, until my mother's face, there until a moment ago, is
swallowed up in this dark, cold realm. That hardened face, turned away from me, is
automatically snatched away, deleted from my memory.
Trudging along in the woods, I think of Miss Saeki. Her face, that calm, faint
smile, the warmth of her hand. I try imagining her as my mother, leaving me behind
when I was four. Without realizing it, I shake my head. The picture is all wrong. Why
would Miss Saeki have done that? Why does she have to hurt me, to permanently screw
up my life? There had to be a hidden, important reason, something deeper I'm just not
getting.
I try to feel what she felt then and get closer to her viewpoint. It isn't easy. I'm the
one who was abandoned, after all, she's the one who did the abandoning. But after a
while I take leave of myself. My soul sloughs off the stiff clothes of the self and turns
into a black crow that sits there on a branch high up in a pine tree in the garden, gazing
down at the four-year-old boy on the porch.
I turn into a theorizing black crow.
"It's not that your mother didn't love you," the boy named Crow says from behind
me. "She loved you very deeply. The first thing you have to do is believe that. That's
your starting point."
"But she abandoned me. She disappeared, leaving me alone where I shouldn't be.
I'm finally beginning to understand how much that hurt. How could she do that if she
really loved me?"
"That's the reality of it. It did happen," the boy named Crow says. "You were hurt
badly, and those scars will be with you forever. I feel sorry for you, I really do. But
think of it like this: It's not too late to recover. You're young, you're tough. You're
adaptable. You can patch up your wounds, lift up your head, and move on. But for her
that's not an option. The only thing she'll ever be is lost. It doesn't matter whether
somebody judges this as good or bad--that's not the point. You're the one who has the
advantage. You ought to consider that."
I don't respond.
"It all really happened, so you can't undo it," Crow tells me. "She shouldn't have
abandoned you then, and you shouldn't have been abandoned. But things in the past are
like a plate that's shattered to pieces. You can never put it back together like it was,
right?"
I nod. You can never put it back together like it was. He's hit the nail on the head.
The boy named Crow continues. "Your mother felt a gut-wrenching kind of fear
and anger inside her, okay? Just like you do now. Which is why she had to abandon
you."
"Even though she loved me?"
"Even though she loved you, she had to abandon you. You need to understand
how she felt then, and learn to accept it. Understand the overpowering fear and anger
she experienced, and feel it as your own--so you won't inherit it and repeat it. The main
thing is this: You have to forgive her. That's not going to be easy, I know, but you have
to do it. That's the only way you can be saved. There's no other way!"
I think about what he's said. The more I think about it, the more confused I get.
My head's spinning, and I feel like my skin's being ripped away. "Is Miss Saeki really
my mother?" I ask.
"Didn't she tell you that theory is still functional?" the boy named Crow says. "So
that's the answer. It's still a functioning hypothesis. That's all I can tell you."
"A working hypothesis until some good counterevidence comes along."
"You got it," Crow says.
"And I have to pursue that hypothesis as far as it'll take me."
"That's it," Crow replies pointedly. "A theory that still doesn't have any good
counterevidence is one worth pursuing. And right now, pursuing it's the only choice you
have. Even if it means sacrificing yourself, you have to pursue it to the bitter end."
"Sacrifice myself?" That certainly has a strange ring to it. I can't quite grasp it.
There's no reply. Worried, I turn around. The boy named Crow is still there. He's
right behind, keeping pace.
"What sort of fear and anger did Miss Saeki have at that time?" I ask him as I turn
back around and walk on. "And where did it come from?"
"What kind of fear and anger do you think she had?" the boy named Crow asks in
return. "Think about it. You've got to figure it out yourself. That's what your head's for."
So I do just that. I have to understand it, accept it, before it's too late. But I still
can't make out that delicate writing left on the shore of my consciousness. There's not
enough time between one wave and the next.
"I'm in love with Miss Saeki," I say. The words slip out naturally.
"I know that," the boy named Crow says curtly.
"I've never felt that before," I go on. "And it's more important to me than anything
else I've ever experienced."
"Of course it is," Crow says. "That goes without saying. That's why you've come
all this way."
"But I still don't get it. You're telling me my mother loved me very much. I want
to believe you, but if that's true, I just don't get it. Why does loving somebody mean you
have to hurt them just as much? I mean, if that's the way it goes, what's the point of
loving someone? Why the hell does it have to be like that?"
I wait for an answer. I keep my mouth shut for a long time, but there's no
response, so I spin around. The boy named Crow is gone. From up above I hear the flap
of wings.
You're totally confused.
Not long afterward, the two soldiers appear.
They're wearing battle fatigues of the old Imperial army. Short-sleeved summer
uniforms, gaiters, and knapsacks. No helmets, just caps with bills, and some kind of
black face paint. Both of them are young. One of them's tall and thin, with round, metalframed
glasses. The other one's short, broad-shouldered, and muscular. They're both
sitting on a flat rock, neither one looking like he's about to leap into battle. Their Arisaka
rifles are on the ground by their feet. The tall soldier seems bored and is chewing on a
stem of grass. The two of them look completely natural, like they belong here.
Unperturbed, they watch as I approach.
There's a small flat clearing around them, like a landing on a staircase.
"Hey," the tall soldier calls out cheerfully.
"How ya doing?" the brawny one says with the smallest of frowns.
"How are you?" I greet them back. I know I should be amazed to see them, but
somehow it doesn't seem weird at all. It's entirely within the realm of possibility.
"We were waiting for you," the tall one says.
"For me?" I ask.
"Sure," he replies. "No one else is coming out here, that's for sure."
"We've been waiting a long time," the brawny one says.
"Not that time's much of a factor here," the tall one adds. "Still, you took longer
than I figured."
"You're the two guys who disappeared in this forest a long, long time ago, right?"
I ask. "During maneuvers?"
The brawny soldier nods. "That's us."
"They searched everywhere for you," I say.
"Yeah, I know," he says. "I know they were looking for us. I know everything
that goes on in this forest. But they're not about to find us, no matter how hard they
look."
"Actually, we didn't get lost," the tall one says. "We ran away."
"Not running away so much as just stumbling onto this spot and deciding to stay
put," the brawny one adds. "That's different from getting lost."
"Not just anybody can find this place," the tall soldier says. "But we did, and now
you have too. It was a stroke of luck--for us, at least."
"If we hadn't found this spot, they would've shipped us overseas," the brawny one
explains. "Over there it was kill or be killed. That wasn't for us. I'm a farmer, originally,
and my buddy here just graduated from college. Neither one of us wants to kill anybody.
And being killed's even worse. Kind of obvious, I'd say."
"How 'bout you?" the tall one asks me. "Would you like to kill anybody, or be
killed?"
I shake my head. No, neither one, definitely not.
"Everybody feels like that," the tall one says. "Or the vast majority, at least. But if
you say, Hey, I don't want to go off to war, the country's not about to break out in smiles
and give you permission to skip out. You can't run away. Japan's a small country, so
where are you going to run to? They'll track you down so fast it'll make your head spin.
That's why we stayed here. This is the only place we could hide." He shakes his head
and goes on. "And we've stayed here ever since. Like you said, from a long, long time
ago. Not that time's a major factor here. There's almost no difference at all between now
and a long, long time ago."
"No difference at all," the brawny one says, waving something away with his
hand.
"You knew I was coming?" I ask.
"Sure thing," the brawny one replies.
"We've been standing guard here for a long time, so we know if somebody's
coming," the other one said. "We're like part of the forest."
"This is the entrance," the brawny one says. "And we're guarding it."
"And right now the entrance happens to be open," the tall one explains. "Before
long, though, it'll close up. If you want to come in, now's the time. It doesn't open up all
that often."
"We'll lead the way," the brawny one says. "The path's hard to follow, so you
need someone to guide you in."
"If you don't come in, then go back where you came from," the tall one says. "It's
not all that hard to find your way back, so don't worry about it. You'll do fine. Then
you'll return to the world you came from, to the life you've been living. The choice is
entirely up to you. Nobody's going to force you to do one or the other. But once you're
in, it isn't easy to turn back."
"Take me inside," I answer without a moment's hesitation.
"Are you sure?" the brawny one asks.
"Somebody's inside I have to see," I say. "At least I think so...."
Slowly, silently, the two of them get up off the rock and shoulder their rifles.
They exchange a glance and walk on ahead of me.
"You must think it's strange we still lug around these heavy lumps of steel," the
tall one says, turning around. "They're worthless. Never had any bullets anyway."
"But they're a kind of sign," the brawny one says, not looking back at me. "A sign
of what we left behind."
"Symbols are important," the tall one adds. "We happen to have these rifles and
soldiers' uniforms, so we play the part of sentries. That's our role. Symbols guide us to
the roles we play."
"Do you have anything like that with you?" the brawny one asks. "Something that
can be a sign?"
I shake my head. "No, I don't have anything. Just memories."
"Hmm...," the brawny one says. "Memories, huh?"
"That's okay. Doesn't matter," the tall one says. "Memories can be a great symbol
too. Course I don't have any idea how well memories will stand up, how long they'll
last."
"Something that has a form or a shape is best, if you can manage it," the brawny
one says. "It's easier to understand."
"Like a rifle," the tall one says. "By the way, what's your name?"
"Kafka Tamura," I answer.
"Kafka Tamura," they both repeat.
"Weird name," the tall one says.
"You got that right," the brawny one adds.
After this we walk in silence down the path.
Chapter 44
They took the three files to a riverbed along the highway and burned them. Hoshino had
bought lighter fluid at a convenience store, and doused the files before setting them
ablaze. Then he and Nakata stood by silently as they watched each page become
engulfed in flames. There was barely a hint of wind, and the smoke rose straight up,
getting lost among the low-hanging gray clouds.
"So we can't read any of these papers?" Hoshino asked.
"No, we're not supposed to," Nakata replied. "I promised Miss Saeki we wouldn't,
and my job is to keep that promise."
"Yeah, keeping promises is important," Hoshino said, wiping away sweat from
his forehead. "It would be nice if we had a shredder, though. That would sure make it a
lot easier. Copy shops have big shredders you can rent pretty cheap. Don't get me wrong,
I'm not complaining. It's just kind of hot to make a bonfire at this time of year. If it were
winter, that'd be another story."
"I'm sorry, but I promised Miss Saeki I'd burn it all up. So that's what Nakata has
to do."
"Okay, then. I'm in no rush. A little heat's not going to kill me. It was just a, what
do you call it--a suggestion."
A cat sauntering along stopped to watch, a skinny, brown-striped cat whose tail
was slightly bent at the tip. A personable cat, by the looks of it. Nakata badly wanted to
talk with it but decided he'd better not, since Hoshino was with him. The cat wouldn't be
able to relax unless they were alone. Besides, Nakata wasn't at all confident he could
speak with cats like he used to. The last thing he wanted was to blurt out something
weird and frighten the poor animal. Before long, the cat grew bored of watching the
bonfire, stood up, and padded away.
A long while later, after the files were completely burned, Hoshino stomped the
ashes into dust. The next strong wind would scatter all the remains. The sun was nearly
setting by then, and crows were flying back to their nests.
"Nobody's gonna read it now," Hoshino said. "I don't know what was written in it,
but it's all gone. A bit of shape and form has disappeared from the world, increasing the
amount of nothingness."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"What's up?"
"I have a question I'd like to ask."
"Fire away."
"Can nothingness increase?"
Hoshino puzzled this one over for a while. "That's a tough one," he admitted. "If
something returns to nothing it becomes zero, but even if you add zero to zero, it's still
zero."
"I don't understand."
"I don't get it either. Thinking about those kinds of things always gives me a
headache."
"So maybe we should stop thinking about it."
"Fine with me," Hoshino said. "Anyhow, the manuscript's all burned up. All the
words in it have disappeared. It's gone back to nothing--that's what I wanted to say."
"That's a load off my mind."
"So this pretty much wraps up what we need to do here, right?" Hoshino asked.
"Yes, we've almost finished what we need to do," Nakata said. "All that's left is to
close up the entrance again."
"That's pretty important, huh?"
"It is. What's opened has to be shut."
"Well, let's get to it. Strike while the iron is hot and all that."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"We can't do it now."
"Why not?"
"It's not time yet," Nakata said. "We have to wait for the right time to shut the
entrance. Before that, I have to get some sleep. Nakata's so sleepy."
Hoshino looked at the old man. "Wait a sec--you're not going to sack out for days
on end again, are you?"
"I can't say, but it may turn out like that."
"Can't we take care of business before you zonk out? Look--once you shift into
sleep mode things kind of come to a halt."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"What's up?"
"I wish we could shut the entrance first. That would be wonderful. But I have to
get some sleep first. I can't keep my eyes open anymore."
"Like your batteries have fizzled out or something?"
"I suppose. It took longer than I thought to do what we needed to do. All my
energy's gone. Would you take me back to where Nakata can get some sleep?"
"No problem. We'll grab a cab and head back to the apartment. Then you can
sleep like a log if you want."
Once they'd settled into the cab Nakata started to nod out.
"You can sleep as much as you want once we're back in the apartment," Hoshino
said. "But hang in there until we get home, okay?"
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yup?"
"I'm sorry to have put you to so much trouble," Nakata murmured vaguely.
"Yeah, I guess you have," Hoshino admitted. "But nobody asked me to come--I
tagged along of my own free will. Like volunteering to shovel snow. So don't worry
about it."
"If you hadn't helped me, Nakata wouldn't have known what to do. I wouldn't
have finished even half of what I had to do."
"Well, if you put it that way, I guess it was worth the effort."
"I'm very grateful to you."
"But you know what?" Hoshino said.
"What?"
"I have a lot to thank you for too, Mr. Nakata."
"Is that right?"
"It's been about ten days since all this began," Hoshino said. "I've skipped out on
work the whole time. The first couple of days I got in touch with them and asked for
some time off, but right now I'm sort of AWOL. I probably won't get my old job back.
Maybe, if I get down on my knees and apologize, they might forgive me. But it's no big
deal. Not to brag or anything, but finding another job won't be hard--I'm a great driver
and a good worker. So I'm not worried about that, and neither should you be. What I'm
trying to say is that I don't have any regrets about being with you. These past ten days
there's been a lot of bizarre stuff going on. Leeches falling from the sky, Colonel
Sanders popping up out of thin air, hot sex with this drop-dead-gorgeous philosophy
major, swiping the entrance stone from that shrine.... A lifetime of weird stuff packed
into ten days. Like we've been doing test runs on a roller coaster or something."
Hoshino stopped here, thinking how to go on. "But you know what, Gramps?"
"Yes?"
"The most amazing thing of all has been you, Mr. Nakata. You changed my life.
These past ten days, I don't know--things look different to me now. Stuff I never
would've given a second glance before seems different. Like music, for instance--music
I used to think was boring really gets to me now. I feel like I've gotta tell somebody
about this or bust, somebody who'll understand what I've gone through. Nothing like this
ever happened to me before. And it's all because of you. I've started to see the world
through your eyes. Not everything, mind you. I like how you look at life, so that's why it
happened. That's why I've stayed with you through thick and thin, why I couldn't leave
you. It's been one of the most meaningful times I've ever had in my life. So there's no
need for you to be thanking me--not that I mind it. I should be thanking you. All I'm
trying to say is you've done me a lot of good, Mr. Nakata. Do you know what I'm
saying?"
But Nakata wasn't listening anymore. His eyes were shut, his breathing regular as
he slept.
"What a happy-go-lucky guy," Hoshino said, and sighed.
Hoshino carried the old man in his arms up to the apartment and put him to bed.
He took off Nakata's shoes but left his clothes on, and covered him with a light
comforter. Nakata squirmed a bit, then settled down as usual, on his back facing the
ceiling. His breathing was quiet and he was still.
Bet we're in for another three-day sleep marathon, Hoshino thought to himself.
But that's not how things turned out. Before noon the next day, Wednesday, Mr.
Nakata was dead. He died peacefully in his sleep. His face was as calm as always, and
he looked like he was just sleeping--only not breathing. Hoshino shook the old man's
shoulders and called out his name, but there was no mistaking it--he was dead. Hoshino
checked his pulse--nothing--and even put a hand mirror near his mouth, but it didn't
cloud up. He'd stopped breathing completely. In this world, at least, he was never going
to wake up again.
Alone in the room with the corpse, Hoshino noticed how, very gradually, all
sounds disappeared. How the real sounds around him steadily lost their reality.
Meaningful sounds all ended up as silence. And the silence grew, deeper and deeper,
like silt on the bottom of the sea. It accumulated at his feet, reached up to his waist, then
up to his chest. He watched as the layers of silence rose up higher and higher. He sat
down on the sofa and gazed at Nakata's face, trying to accept the fact that he was really
gone. It took him a long time to accept it. As he sat there the air began to feel strangely
heavy and he could no longer tell if his thoughts and feelings were really his. But there
were a few things he started to understand.
Maybe death would take Nakata back to the way he used to be. When he was
alive, he was always good old Nakata, a not-so-bright, cat-talking old man. Maybe death
was the only road back to being the "normal Nakata" he'd always talked about.
"Hey, Gramps," Hoshino said. "Maybe I shouldn't say this, but if you gotta die,
this isn't such a bad way to go."
Nakata had passed away calmly in his sleep, most likely not thinking of anything.
His face was peaceful, with no signs of suffering, regret, or confusion. Very Nakata-like,
Hoshino concluded. But what his life had really meant, Hoshino had no idea. Not that
anybody's life had more clear-cut meaning to it. What's really important for people, what
really has dignity, is how they die. Compared to that, he thought, how you lived doesn't
amount to much. Still, how you live determines how you die. These thoughts ran
through his head as he stared at the face of the dead old man.
But one critical thing remained. Someone had to close up the entrance stone.
Nakata had finished everything he'd set out to do except that. The stone was right there,
at Hoshino's feet, and he knew that when the time came he had to roll it over and shut up
the entrance. But Nakata had warned him that if you mishandled it, the stone could be
very dangerous. There had to be a right way of turning the stone over--but also a wrong
way. If you just powered it over, that could screw up the entire world.
"I can't do anything about your having died, Gramps, but you've left me in a real
bind here," Hoshino said, addressing the corpse, which of course didn't respond.
There was also the question of what to do with the body. The normal response
would be to ring up the police or the hospital and have them take it. Ninety-nine percent
of the people in the world would have done exactly that, and Hoshino wanted to. But the
police were hunting for Nakata in connection with that murder case, and getting in touch
with the authorities at this point would definitely put Hoshino in a precarious position.
The police would haul him off and grill him for hours. Explaining everything that had
happened was the last thing he wanted to do, plus there was the fact that he was no fan
of law enforcement. If he could avoid having anything to do with cops, so much the
better.
And how the hell do I explain this apartment? he wondered.
An old man dressed up like Colonel Sanders lent us the place. Said he'd prepared
it specially for us and that we could use it as long as we liked. Would the police really
buy that? Colonel Sanders? Is he with the U.S. army? No, you know--the Kentucky
Fried Chicken guy. You must've seen their billboards, right, detective? Yeah, that's the
guy--glasses, white goatee.... He was a pimp working the back alleys of Takamatsu. He
got a girl for me. Explain stuff like that and the cops would call him an idiot and give
him a swift punch to the head. Cops, Hoshino concluded, not for the first time in his life,
are just gangsters who get paid by the state.
He let out a deep sigh.
What I've got to do, he thought, is get out of here right now, as far away as I can.
I can make an anonymous call to the cops from a pay phone at the station. Give them the
address here, say that somebody's died. Then hop a train back to Nagoya. They'll never
connect me to the case. The old man died a natural death, so the cops won't launch some
investigation. They'll hand over the body to his relatives and there'll be a simple funeral,
end of story. Then I'll go to my company, bow and scrape in front of the president: It'll
never happen again, I swear. I'll work hard from now on. Whatever it takes to get my old
job back.
He started packing, cramming a change of clothes in his bag. He put on his
Chunichi Dragons cap, pulling his ponytail through the opening in back, and his dark
green sunglasses. Thirsty, he got a Diet Pepsi from the refrigerator. As he leaned back
against the fridge and drank, he noticed the round stone next to the sofa. He went into
the bedroom and looked at Nakata's corpse one more time. He still didn't look like he
was dead. He looked like he was quietly breathing, and Hoshino half expected him to
suddenly sit up and say, Mr. Hoshino, it's all a mistake. Nakata's not really dead! But he
didn't. Nakata was most definitely deceased. There weren't going to be any miracles.
The old man had already crossed the great divide.
Pepsi in hand, Hoshino stood there, shaking his head. I can't just go off and leave
the stone behind, he thought. If I did, Mr. Nakata won't be able to truly rest in peace. He
was such a conscientious type, always making sure things were done just right. And he
would've finished this final task, if his batteries hadn't run out. Hoshino crushed the
empty aluminum can and tossed it in the trash. Still thirsty, he went back into the
kitchen and popped open another Pepsi.
Mr. Nakata told me how he wanted, if only one time, to be able to read, Hoshino
remembered. He said he wanted to go to a library and be able to choose any book and
read it. But he died before he could make that dream come true. Maybe now that he's
dead he's gone on to another world, where he's become a normal Nakata, and can read.
As long as he was in this world, though, he never could. In fact, his final act on earth
was quite the opposite--burning up writing. Sending all those words on the pages off
into the void. Kind of ironic, when you think about it. That being the case, though,
Hoshino thought, I need to fulfill his final wish. I've got to close the entrance. I wasn't
able to take him to the movies, or the aquarium--so it's the least I can do for him, now
that he's gone.
He drained his second can of Pepsi, went over to the sofa, crouched down, and
tried lifting the stone. It wasn't so heavy. Not exactly light, either, but it didn't take all
that much to lift it up. About as heavy as when he and Colonel Sanders had stolen it
from the shrine. About as heavy as the kind of stones used to weigh down pickles as
they ferment. That means right now it's just a stone, Hoshino thought. When the stone's
acting as an entrance, it's so heavy you have to kill yourself to pick it up. But when it's
light like this, it's just an ordinary stone. Something extraordinary has to happen first, for
the stone to become as heavy as it did and change into the entrance stone. Like lightning
striking all over town or something...
Hoshino went to the window, opened the curtain, and gazed up at the sky from
the veranda. The sky was the same as the day before, a mass of drab gray clouds. But it
didn't look like it was going to rain, much less thunder. He perked up his ears and
sniffed the air, but everything seemed the same as yesterday. Steady as she goes seemed
to be today's theme for the world.
"Hey, Gramps," he said aloud to the dead man. "Guess I just have to wait here
with you for something out of the ordinary to happen. What the heck that could be, I
have no idea. Or even when it might take place. Plus it's June, and your body's gonna
decay and start to stink pretty soon. I know you don't want to hear this, but that's nature
for you. And the more time that passes, and the later I get in touch with the cops, the
worse it'll get for me. I mean, I'll do whatever I can, but I just wanted you to know the
situation, okay?"
There was no reply, of course.
Hoshino wandered around the room. That's it! Colonel Sanders might get in touch!
He'd know what to do with the stone. Him you could always count on for some
warmhearted, practical advice. But no matter how long he stared at the phone, it just sat
there, a silent, unnecessarily introspective object. Nobody knocked on the door, not a
single letter arrived. And nothing out of the ordinary happened. The weather stayed the
same, and no flashes of inspiration struck him. One expressionless moment after another
ticked by. Noon came and went, the afternoon quietly reeling into twilight. The hands of
the electric clock on the wall skimmed smoothly over the surface of time like a whirligig
beetle, and on the bed Mr. Nakata was still dead. Hoshino didn't feel hungry at all. He
had a third can of Pepsi and dutifully munched on some crackers.
At six p. m. he sat down on the sofa, picked up the remote, and switched on the
TV. He watched the NHK evening news, but nothing caught his attention. It had been an
ordinary day, a slow news day. The announcer's voice started to grate on his nerves, and
when the program was over he turned off the TV. It was getting darker outside, and
finally night took over. An even greater stillness and quiet enveloped the room.
"Hey, Gramps," Hoshino said to Nakata. "Could you get up, just for a few
minutes? I don't know what the hell to do. And I miss your voice."
Naturally Nakata didn't reply. He was still on the other side of the divide.
Wordlessly he continued as he was, dead. The silence grew deeper, so deep that if you
listened carefully you might very well catch the sound of the earth revolving on its axis.
Hoshino went out to the living room and put on the Archduke Trio. As he listened
to the first theme, tears came to his eyes, then the floodgates opened. Jeez, he thought,
when was the last time I cried? He couldn't remember.
Chapter 45
As advertised, the path from the "entrance" on is hard to follow. Actually, it's pretty
much given up on trying to be a path. The farther we go, the deeper and more enormous
the forest gets. The slope gets a whole lot steeper, the ground more overgrown with
bushes and undergrowth. The sky has just about disappeared, and it's so dim that it
seems like twilight. Thick spiderwebs loom up all over the place, and the air's thick with
the smell of plants. The silence gets even deeper, like the forest is trying to reject this
invasion of its territory by human beings. The soldiers, rifles slung across their backs,
seem oblivious as they easily cut through openings in the thick foliage. They're
amazingly fast as they slip past the low-hanging branches, clamber up rocks, leap over
hollows, neatly avoiding all the thorns.
I scramble to keep up and not lose sight of them as they forge on ahead. They
never check to see if I'm still there. It's like they're testing me, to see how much I can
handle. I don't know why, but it almost feels like they're angry with me. They don't say a
word, not just to me but to each other. They're totally focused on walking. Without a
word between them, they take turns in the lead. The black barrels of the rifles on their
backs swing back and forth in front of me, as regular as a metronome. The whole thing
starts to get hypnotic after a while. My mind starts to wander, like it's slipping on ice, to
somewhere else. But I still have to focus on keeping up with their relentless pace, so I
march on, the sweat pouring off me now.
"We going too fast for you?" the brawny soldier finally turns around and asks.
He's not out of breath at all.
"No, I'm fine," I tell him. "I'm hanging in there."
"You're young, and look like you're in good shape," the tall one comments
without looking around.
"We know this path real well, so sometimes we speed up too much," the brawny
one explains. "So tell me if we're going too fast. Don't be shy, okay? Just say the word
and we'll slow down. But understand we don't want to go any slower than we have to.
You know what I'm saying?"
"I'll let you know if I can't keep up," I tell him, forcing myself not to breathe too
hard, so they won't have any idea how tired this is making me. "Do we have far to go?"
"No, not really," the tall one answers.
"We're almost there," the other one adds.
I'm not sure I really believe him. Like they said, time's not much of a factor here.
So we walk on for a while without talking, at a less blistering pace than before. It
seems like they've finished testing me.
"Are there any poisonous snakes in this forest?" I ask, since it's been worrying me.
"Poisonous snakes, eh?" the tall one with the glasses says without turning around.
He never turns around when he talks, always facing forward like something absolutely
critical's about to leap out in front of us at any moment. "I never thought about it."
"Could be," the brawny one says, turning to look at me. "I haven't seen any, but
there might be some. Not that it matters even if there are."
"What we're trying to say," the tall one adds casually, "is that the forest isn't out
to harm you."
"So you don't need to worry about snakes or anything," the brawny one says.
"Feel better now?"
"Yes," I reply.
"No other here--poisonous snakes or mushrooms, venomous spiders or insects--is
going to do you any harm," the tall soldier says, as always without turning around.
"Other?" I ask. I can't get a mental picture of what he means. I must be tired.
"An other, no other thing," he says. "No thing's going to harm you here. We're in
the deepest part of the forest, after all. And no one--not even yourself--is going to hurt
you."
I try to figure out what he means. But what with the exhaustion, sweat, and
hypnotic effect of this repetitive journey through the woods, my brain can't form a
coherent thought.
"When we were soldiers they used to force us to practice ripping open the
enemy's stomach with a bayonet," the brawny one says. "You know the best way to stab
someone with a bayonet?"
"No," I reply.
"Well, first you stab your bayonet deep into his belly, then you twist it sideways.
That rips the guts to ribbons. Then the guy dies a horrible, slow, painful death. But if
you just stab without twisting, then your enemy can jump up and rip your guts to shreds.
That's the kind of world we were in."
Guts. Oshima told me once that intestines are a metaphor for a labyrinth. My
head's full of all kinds of thoughts, all intertwined and tangled. I can't tell the difference
between one thing and another.
"Do you know why people have to do such cruel things like that to other people?"
the tall soldier asks.
"I have no idea," I reply.
"Neither do I," he says. "I don't care who the enemy is--Chinese soldiers,
Russians, Americans. I never wanted to rip open their guts. But that's the kind of world
we lived in, and that's why we ran away. Don't get me wrong, the two of us weren't
cowards. We were actually pretty good soldiers. We just couldn't put up with that rush
to violence. I don't imagine you're a coward, either."
"I really don't know," I answer honestly. "But I've always tried to get stronger."
"That's very important," the brawny one says, turning in my direction again.
"Very important--to do your best to get stronger."
"I can tell you're pretty strong," the tall one says. "Most kids your age wouldn't
make it this far."
"Yeah, it is pretty impressive," the brawny one pipes in.
The two of them come to a halt at this point. The tall soldier takes off his glasses,
rubs the sides of his nose a couple of times, then puts his glasses on again. Neither one's
out of breath or has even worked up a sweat.
"Thirsty?" the tall one asks me.
"A little," I reply. Actually, my canteen gone along with my daypack, I'm dying
of thirst. He unhooks the canteen from his waist and hands it to me. I take a few gulps of
the lukewarm water. The liquid quenches every pore of my body. I wipe the mouth of
the canteen off and hand it back. "Thanks," I say. The tall soldier nods silently.
"We've reached the ridge," the brawny soldier says.
"We're going to go straight to the bottom without stopping, so watch your
footing," the tall one says.
I follow them carefully down the tricky, slippery slope. We get about halfway
down, then turn a corner and cut through some trees, and all of a sudden a world opens
up below us. The two soldiers stop, and turn around to look at me. They don't say a
thing, but their eyes speak volumes. This is the place, they're telling me. The place
you're going to enter. I stand there with them and gaze out at that world.
The whole place is a basin neatly carved out of the natural contours of the land.
How many people might be living there I have no idea, but there can't be many--the
place isn't big enough. There're a couple of roads, with buildings here and there along
either side. Small roads, and equally small buildings. Nobody's out on the roads. The
buildings are all expressionless, built less for beauty than to withstand the elements. The
place is too small to be called a town. There aren't any shops as far as I can tell. No signs
or bulletin boards. It's like a bunch of buildings, all the same size and shape, just
happened to come together to make up a little community. None of the buildings have
gardens, and not a single tree lines the roads. Like with the forest all around there's no
need for any extra plants or trees.
A faint breeze is cutting through the woods, making the leaves of the trees around
me tremble. That anonymous rustling forms ripples on the folds of my mind. I rest a
hand against a tree trunk and close my eyes. Those ripples seem to be a sign, a signal of
some sort, but it's like a foreign language I can't decipher. I give up, open my eyes, and
gaze out again at this brand-new world before me. Standing there halfway down the
slope, staring down at this place with two soldiers, I feel those ripples shifting inside me.
These signs reconfigure themselves, the metaphors transform, and I'm drifting away,
away from myself. I'm a butterfly, flitting along the edges of creation. Beyond the edge
of the world there's a space where emptiness and substance neatly overlap, where past
and future form a continuous, endless loop. And hovering about there are signs no one
has ever read, chords no one has ever heard.
I try to calm my ragged breathing. My heart still isn't back in one piece, but at
least I'm not afraid.
Without a word the soldiers start walking again, and silently I follow along. As
we go farther down the slope, the town draws closer. I see a small stream running
alongside a road, with a stone wall as an embankment. The beautiful clear water gurgles
pleasantly. Everything here is simple, and cozy. Slim poles with wires strung between
them dot the area, which means they must have electricity. Electricity? Out here?
The place is surrounded by a high, green ridge. The sky's still a mass of gray
clouds. The soldiers and I walk down the road but don't pass a single person.
Everything's completely still, not a sound to be heard. Maybe they're all shut up inside
their homes, holding their breath, waiting for us to go.
My companions take me to one of the dwellings. Strange thing is, it's the same
size and shape as Oshima's cabin. Like one was the model for the other. There's a porch
out front, and a chair. The building has a flat roof with a stovepipe sticking out the top.
There's a plain single bed in the bedroom, all neatly made up. The only differences are
that the bedroom and living room are separate from each other, and there's a toilet inside
and the place has electricity. There's even a fridge in the kitchen, a small, old-fashioned
model. A light hangs down from the ceiling. And there's a TV. A TV?
"For the time being, you're supposed to stay here till you get settled," the brawny
soldier says. "It won't be for that long. For the time being."
"Like I said before, time isn't much of a factor here," the tall one says.
The other one nods in agreement. "Not a factor at all."
"Where could the electricity be coming from?"
They look at each other.
"There's a small wind-power station farther on in the forest," the tall one explains.
"The wind's always blowing there. Gotta have electricity, right?"
"No electricity and you can't use the fridge," the brawny one says. "No fridge and
you can't keep food for long."
"You'd manage somehow without it," the tall one says. "Though it sure is a nice
thing to have."
"If you get hungry," the brawny one adds, "help yourself to whatever's in the
fridge. There isn't much, I'm afraid."
"There's no meat here, no fish, coffee, or liquor," the tall one says. "It's hard at
first, but you'll get used to it."
"But you do have eggs and cheese and milk," the brawny soldier says. "Gotta
have your protein, right?"
"They don't make those other things here," the tall one explains, "so you have to
go somewhere else to get them. And swap something for them."
"Somewhere else?"
The tall one nods. "That's right. We're not cut off from the world here. There is a
somewhere else. It might take a while, but you'll understand."
"Someone will be along in the evening to make dinner for you," the brawny
soldier says. "If you get bored before then, you can watch TV."
"They have shows on the TV?"
"Well, I don't know what's on," the tall one replies, a bit flustered. He tilts his
head and looks at his companion.
His brawny friend tilts his head too, a doubtful look on his face. "To be honest
with you, I don't know much about TV. I've never watched it."
"They put the TV there for people who've just come here," the tall one says.
"But you should be able to watch something," the brawny one says.
"Just rest up for a while," the tall one says. "We have to get back to our post."
"Thanks for bringing me here."
"No problem," the brawny one says. "You have much stronger legs than the
others we've brought here. Lots of people can't keep up. Some we even have to carry on
our backs. So you were one of the easy ones."
"If memory serves," the tall soldier says, "you said there's somebody you want to
see here."
"That's right."
"I'm sure you'll meet whoever that is before long," he says, nodding a couple of
times for emphasis. "It's a small world here."
"I hope you get used to it soon," the brawny soldier says.
"Once you get used to it, the rest is easy," the tall soldier adds.
"I really appreciate it."
The two of them stand at attention and salute, then shoulder their rifles and leave,
walking quickly down the road back toward their post. They must guard the entrance
there day and night.
I go to the kitchen and check out what's in the fridge. There are some tomatoes, a
chunk of cheese, eggs, carrots, turnips even, and a large porcelain jug of milk. Butter,
too. A loaf of bread's on a shelf, and I tear off a piece and taste it. A little hard, but not
bad.
The kitchen has a sink and a faucet. I turn the faucet and water comes out, clear
and cold. Since they have electricity, they must pump water up from a well. I fill up a
cup and drink it.
I go over to the window and look outside. The sky's still covered with gray clouds,
though it doesn't look like it's going to rain anytime soon. I stare out the window a long
time but still don't see any sign of other people. It's like the town's dead. Or else for
some reason everybody's trying to avoid me.
I walk away from the window and sit down in a hard, straight-backed wooden
chair. There're three chairs altogether, and a square dining table that's been varnished a
number of times. Nothing at all's hanging on the plaster walls, no paintings, no photos,
not even a calendar. Just pure white walls. A single bulb dangles from the ceiling, with a
simple glass shade that's discolored by heat.
The room has been nicely cleaned. I run my finger over the tabletop and the
window frame and there's no dust at all. The windows, too, are sparkling clean. The pots,
plates, and various utensils in the kitchen aren't new, but it's clear they've been well
cared for and are all clean. Next to the work space in the kitchen are two old electric hot
plates. I switch one of them on, and right away the coil turns red.
There's an old color TV in a heavy wooden cabinet that I'm guessing is fifteen or
twenty years old. There's no remote control. It looks like something that was thrown
away and then retrieved. Which could be said of all the electric items, all of which look
like they were saved from the trash. Not that they were dirty or anything, or didn't work,
just that they're all faded and out of date.
I turn on the switch on the TV, and an old movie's playing, The Sound of Music.
My teacher took us all to see it on a widescreen movie theater when I was in grade
school. No adults were around to take me to the theater, so it's one of the few movies I
saw when I was a kid. On TV they're at the part where the difficult, uptight father,
Captain von Trapp, has gone to Vienna on business, and Maria, the children's tutor,
takes them on an outing in the mountains. They all sit together on the grass and she
plays guitar and they sing a couple of harmless songs. It's a famous scene. I plant myself
in front of the TV, glued to the movie. Just like when I first saw it, I wonder how things
would've turned out if I'd had someone like Maria with me. Needless to say, nobody like
that ever showed up in my life.
I flash back to reality. Why in the world do I have to watch The Sound of Music
right now? Why that movie? Maybe the people here have hooked up some sort of
satellite dish and can get the signal from a station. Or is it a videotape being played
somewhere and shown on this set? I'd guess it's a tape, because when I change channels
the other ones show only sandstorms. A vicious sandstorm's exactly what it reminds me
of, the gravelly white, inorganic static.
They're singing "Edelweiss" when I turn off the set. Quiet returns to the room. I'm
thirsty, so I go to the kitchen and drink some milk from the jug. The milk's thick and
fresh, and tastes a hundred times better than those packs of milk you buy in convenience
stores. As I down glass after glass, I suddenly remember the scene in François Truffaut's
film 400 Blows where Antoine runs away from home and, early one morning, gets
hungry and steals a bottle of milk that's been delivered to somebody's front door, then
drinks it as he makes his getaway. It's a large bottle, so it takes him a while to drink it all
down. A sad, distressing scene--though it's hard to believe that just drinking milk could
be so sad. That's another one of the few movies from my childhood. I was in fifth grade,
and the title caught my attention, so I took the train to Ikebukuro alone, saw the film,
then rode the train back. As soon as I got out of the theater, I bought some milk and
drank it. I couldn't help it.
After drinking all that milk now I get sleepy. An overwhelming, almost nauseous
sleepiness comes over me. My thoughts slow down, and finally stop, like a train pulling
into a station, and I can't think straight anymore, like the core of my body's coagulating.
I walk into the bedroom, make a tangle out of getting my pants and shoes off, then
slump down on the bed, bury my face in the pillow, and close my eyes. The pillow
smells like the sunlight, a precious smell. I quietly breathe it in, breathe it out, and fall
asleep before I know it.
When I wake up it's dark all around. I open my eyes and try to figure out where I
am. Two soldiers led me through the forest to a small town next to a stream, right?
Slowly my memory's coming back. The scene comes into focus, and I hear a familiar
melody. "Edelweiss." Out in the kitchen there's a faint, intimate clattering of pots and
pans. Light spills into the bedroom through a crack in the door, forming a yellow line on
the floor. Kind of an old-fashioned, powdery yellow light.
I try to get out of bed but my body's numb all over. I take a deep breath and look
up at the ceiling. I hear the sound of plates, of someone scurrying busily across the floor,
preparing a meal for me, I imagine. I'm finally able to stand up. Though it takes a while,
I struggle into my pants, my socks and shoes. Quietly I grab the knob and open the door.
A young girl's in the kitchen cooking. Her back to me, she's leaning over a pot,
tasting the food with a spoon, but when she hears the door open she looks up and turns
around. It's her. The same girl who visited my room in the library and gazed at the
painting on the wall. The fifteen-year-old Miss Saeki. She's wearing the same clothes, a
long-sleeved, light blue dress. The only thing different is now her hair's pinned back.
She gives me a small, warm smile, and a powerful emotion overwhelms me, like the
whole world's been turned upside down, like everything tangible had fallen apart but has
now been put back together. But this girl is no illusion, certainly no ghost. She's a living,
breathing young girl, someone you can touch, standing in a real kitchen at twilight,
cooking me a real meal. Her small breasts jut beneath her dress, her neck as white as
porcelain fresh from the kiln. It's all real.
"Oh, you're awake?" she asks.
No voice comes out of me. I'm still trying to pull myself together.
"You seem to have slept very well," she says. She turns back to tasting the dish.
"If you didn't wake up I was going to put the meal on the table and leave."
"I wasn't planning to sleep so much," I finally manage to say.
"You came all the way through the forest," she says, "so you must be hungry."
"I'm not sure. But I think I am." I want to reach out and see if I can actually touch
her. But I can't. I just stand there, drinking her in. I listen to the sounds she makes as she
bustles around the kitchen.
She ladles hot stew onto a plain white plate and carries it over to the table. There's
a bowl of salad, too, tomatoes and greens, and a large loaf of bread. There are potatoes
and carrots in the stew. The fragrance brings back fond memories. I breathe it all in
deeply and realize I'm starving. I have to eat something. As I pick up a scuffed fork and
spoon and begin eating, the girl sits in a chair to the side and watches me with a serious
expression on her face, like watching me eat is a critical part of her job. Occasionally
she brushes back her hair.
"They told me you're fifteen," she says.
"That's right," I reply, buttering a slice of bread. "I just turned fifteen."
"I'm fifteen too," she says.
I nod. I know that, I almost say. But it's too soon to say that. I take another bite.
"I'll be making the meals here for a while," she says. "The cleaning and washing
as well. There are clothes in the dresser in the bedroom, so feel free to help yourself.
You can just put your laundry in the basket and I'll take care of it."
"Somebody gave you these jobs?"
She looks fixedly at me but doesn't answer. It's like my question's taken a wrong
turn and been sucked into some nameless space.
"What's your name?" I ask, trying a different tack.
She shakes her head slightly. "I don't have a name. We don't have names here."
"But if you don't have a name, how can I call you?"
"There's no need to call me," she says. "If you need me, I'll be here."
"I guess I don't need my name here, either."
She nods. "You're you, you see, and nobody else. You are you, right?"
"I guess so," I say. Though I'm not so sure. Am I really me?
All the while she's steadily gazing at me.
"Do you remember the library?" I come right out and ask her.
"The library?" She shakes her head. "No... There's a library far away, but not
here."
"There's a library?"
"Yes, but there aren't any books in it."
"If there aren't any books, then what is there?"
She tilts her head but doesn't respond. Again my question's taken a wrong turn
and vanished.
"Have you ever been there?"
"A long time ago," she says.
"But it's not for reading books?"
She nods. "There aren't any books there."
I eat in silence for a time. The stew, the salad, the bread. She doesn't say anything
either, just observes me with that serious look.
"How was the food?" she asks after I finish eating.
"It was really good."
"Even without any meat or fish?"
I point to the empty plate. "Well, I didn't leave anything, right?"
"I made it."
"It was really good," I repeat. It's the truth.
Being with her I feel a pain, like a frozen knife stuck in my chest. An awful pain,
but the funny thing is I'm thankful for it. It's like that frozen pain and my very existence
are one. The pain is an anchor, mooring me here. The girl stands up to boil some water
and make tea. While I'm sitting at the table drinking it, she carries the dirty dishes out to
the kitchen and starts washing them. I watch her do all this. I want to say something, but
when I'm with her words no longer function as they're supposed to. Or maybe the
meaning that ties them together has vanished? I stare at my hands and think of the
dogwood outside the window, glinting in the moonlight. That's where the blade that's
stabbing me in the heart is.
"Will I see you again?" I ask.
"Of course," the girl replies. "Like I said before, if you need me, I'll be here."
"You're not going to suddenly disappear?"
She doesn't say anything, just gazes at me with a strange look on her face, like
Where-do-you-think-I'd-go?
"I've met you before," I venture. "In another land, in another library."
"If you say so," she says, touching her hair to check that it's still pinned back. Her
voice is expressionless, like she's trying to let me know the topic doesn't interest her.
"I think I've come here to meet you one more time. You, and one other woman."
She looks up and nods seriously. "Going through the deep woods to get here."
"That's right. I had to see you and that other woman again."
"And you've met me."
I nod.
"It's like I told you," she says. "If you need me, I'll be here."
After she washes up, she puts the pots and plates back on the shelf and drapes a
canvas bag across her shoulder. "I'll be back tomorrow morning," she tells me. "I hope
you get used to being here soon."
I stand at the door and watch as she vanishes into the gloom. I'm alone again in
the little cabin, inside a closed circle. Time isn't a factor here. Nobody here has a name.
She'll be here as long as I need her. She's fifteen here. Eternally fifteen, I imagine. But
what's going to happen to me? Am I going to stay fifteen here? Is age, too, not a factor
here?
I stand in the doorway long after she's disappeared, gazing vacantly at the scenery
outside. There's no moon or stars in the sky. Lights are on in a few other buildings,
spilling out of the windows. The same antique, yellowish light that illuminates this room.
But I still can't see anybody else. Just the lights. Dark shadows widen their grip on the
world outside. Farther in the distance, blacker than the darkness, the ridge rises up, and
the forest surrounding this town like a wall.
Chapter 46
After Nakata's death, Hoshino couldn't pull himself away from the apartment. With the
entrance stone there, something might happen, and when it did he wanted to be close
enough that he could react in time. Watching over the stone had been Nakata's job, and
now it was his. He set the AC in Nakata's room to the lowest possible temperature and
turned it on full blast, checking that the windows were shut tight. The air in the room
had that special solidity found only in a room with a corpse in it. "Not too cold for you, I
hope?" he said to Nakata, who naturally didn't have an opinion one way or the other.
Hoshino plopped down on the living-room sofa, trying to pass the time. He didn't
feel like listening to music or reading. Twilight came on, the room by degrees turning
dark, but he didn't even get up to switch on the light. He felt completely drained, and
once ensconced on the sofa couldn't rouse himself enough to get up. Time came slowly
and passed slowly, so leisurely that at times he could swear it had stealthily doubled
back on itself.
When his own grandfather died, he thought, it was hard, but nothing like this.
He'd suffered through a long illness, and they all knew it was just a matter of time. So
when he did die, they were prepared. It makes a big difference whether or not you have
a chance to steel yourself for the inevitable. But that's not the only difference, Hoshino
concluded. There was something about Nakata's death that forced him to think long and
hard.
Suddenly hungry, he went to the kitchen, defrosted some fried rice in the
microwave, and ate half of it along with a beer. Afterward he went back to check on
Nakata. Maybe he'd come back to life, he thought. But no, the old man was still dead.
The room was like a walk-in freezer, so cold you could store ice cream in there.
Spending a night in the same house as a corpse was a first, and Hoshino couldn't
settle down. Not that he was scared or anything, he told himself. It didn't make his flesh
crawl. He just didn't know how he should act with a dead man beside him. The flow of
time is so different for the dead and the living. Same with sounds. That's why I can't
calm down, he decided. But what can you do? Mr. Nakata's already gone over to the
world of the dead, and I'm still in the land of the living. Of course there's going be a gap.
He got up from the sofa and sat down next to the stone. He started stroking it with his
palms, like he was petting a cat.
"What the heck am I supposed to do?" he asked the stone. "I want to turn Mr.
Nakata over to somebody who'll take care of him, but until I take care of you, I can't.
You want to clue me in?"
But there was no reply. For the moment the stone was just a stone, and Hoshino
understood this. He could ask till he was blue in the face but couldn't expect a response.
Even so, he sat beside the stone, rubbing it. He tossed out a couple questions, made an
appeal to logic, and did his best to win the sympathy vote. Though he knew it was
pointless, he couldn't think of an alternative. Mr. Nakata had sat here all the time talking
to the stone, so why shouldn't he?
Still, talking to a stone, trying to get it to feel your pain--that's pretty pathetic, he
thought. I mean, isn't that where they get that expression? As heartless as a stone?
He stood up, thinking he'd watch the news on TV, but thought better of it and sat
down again beside the stone. Silence is probably best for now, he decided. Got to listen
carefully, wait for whatever it is that's going to happen. "But waiting around isn't exactly
my thing," Hoshino said to the stone. Come to think of it, I've always been the impatient
type, and man have I paid for it! Always leaping before I look, always screwing things
up. You're as antsy as a cat in heat, my grandpa used to tell me. But now I've got to sit
tight and wait. Gut it out!
Everything was quiet except for the groan of the AC going full blast next door.
The clock showed nine, then ten, but nothing happened. Time passed, the night grew
deeper, nothing else. Hoshino dragged his blankets into the living room, lay down on the
sofa, and pulled them over him. He figured that it was better, even asleep, to be near the
stone in case something happened. He turned off the light and shut his eyes.
"Hey, stone! I'm going to sleep now," he called out. "We'll talk again tomorrow.
It's been a long day, and I need some shut-eye." Man, he thought, was that an
understatement. Long did not begin to describe it. "Hey, Gramps!" he called out more
loudly. "Mr. Nakata? You hear me?" No reply.
Hoshino sighed, closed his eyes, adjusted his pillow, and fell asleep. He slept the
whole night without a break, without a single dream. In the next room, Nakata slept his
own deep, dreamless, stone-hard sleep.
As soon as he got up, just past seven the next morning, Hoshino went right in to
check on Nakata. As before, the AC was roaring full blast, blowing cold air into the
room. And in the midst of that chilled room, Nakata was still dead. Compared to the
night before, death seemed to have a tighter grip on him. His skin had grown ashen, his
closed eyes more fixed and solemn. He wasn't about to come back to life, suddenly sit
up, and say, My apologies, Mr. Hoshino. Nakata just fell asleep. I'm sorry. No need to
worry, I'll take it from here--and then deal with the stone. That was never going to
happen. Nakata's checked out for good, Hoshino thought, and that's a fact.
He started shivering from the cold, so he stepped out and shut the door, then went
into the kitchen, brewed some coffee in the coffeemaker and drank two cups, made
some toast and ate it with butter and jam. After eating he sat in the kitchen, smoked a
couple of cigarettes, and gazed out the window. The clouds had blown away sometime
during the night, leaving an unbroken sunny summer sky. The stone was in its
customary spot next to the sofa. It didn't sleep a wink, didn't wake up, just crouched
there, unmoving, the entire night. He tried picking it up and easily lifted it.
"Hey there," Hoshino said in a cheerful voice, "it's me. Your old pal Hoshino,
remember? Looks like it's just you and me today."
The stone was--not unexpectedly--speechless.
"Ah, that's okay. Doesn't matter if you don't remember. We have lots of time to
get to know each other--no need to rush."
He sat down beside the stone, started rubbing it, and wondered what sort of things
you might talk about with a stone. Having a conversation with a stone was a first and he
couldn't think of any appropriate topics. Best to avoid anything difficult this early in the
morning, he figured. The day was long, and whatever popped into his head would be
fine.
He gave it some thought and chose a favorite subject: girls. He reviewed each and
every girl he'd ever slept with. If he stuck to the ones whose names he remembered, it
didn't add up to all that many. He counted them off on his fingers. Six, all told. If I add
the ones whose names I don't know, he thought, there'd be a lot more, but we'll put those
on hold.
"I guess it's pretty pointless talking to a stone about girls I've slept with," he said.
"And I suppose you aren't exactly thrilled to hear all about my exploits first thing in the
morning. But I can't think of anything else, okay? Who knows, maybe some lighter
topic'll do you some good for a change. FYI and all that."
Hoshino related some episodes in as much detail as he could recall. The first was
when he was in high school, back when he was into motorcycles and getting into trouble.
The girl was three years older than him and worked in a little bar in Gifu City. They
pretty much lived together for a while. The girl was serious about the relationship, said
she couldn't live without him. She phoned my parents, he remembered, but they were
none too happy about it, and the whole thing was getting too intense, so once I
graduated from high school I joined the Self-Defense Force. Right after I joined up I got
stationed at a base in Yamanashi Prefecture, and the relationship fizzled out. I never saw
her again.
"I guess lazy's my middle name," Hoshino explained to the stone. "And when
things get sticky I tend to head for the door. Not to brag or anything, but I'm pretty quick
on my feet. I've never followed anything to the bitter end. Which is sort of a problem, I
suppose."
The second girl he met near the base in Yamanashi. He was off duty one day and
helped her fix a flat on her Suzuki Alto. She was a year older than him and attending
nursing school.
"She was a nice kid," Hoshino said to the stone. "Big breasts, a very warm person.
And man, did she like to get it on! I was only nineteen, and we used to spend every day
between the sheets. Problem was, she was jealous like you wouldn't believe. If I didn't
see her on my days off she'd give me the third degree, ask where I went, what I did, who
I was with. I told her the truth, but that didn't satisfy her. That's why we broke up. We
were together for about a year, I guess.... I don't know how you are, but I can't stand
anyone getting on my case. I feel like I can't breathe, and it makes me depressed. So I
ran away. The cool thing about the SDF is you can always hole up on base till the whole
thing blows over. And there's nothing anybody can do about it. If you want to dump a
girl with no problems, going into the SDF's your ticket. Good thing to remember. But
it's not all roses--not with digging foxholes and piling up sandbags and crap."
The more he talked, the more Hoshino realized how pointless his life had been.
Four of the six girls he'd gone out with had been nice. (The other two, if you looked at it
objectively, had personality problems, he decided.) Most of them had treated him pretty
well. No drop-dead beauties among them, though each was cute in her own way, and let
him have sex whenever he felt like it. Never complained if he skipped foreplay and went
straight to the main course. They fixed meals for him on his days off, bought him
presents on his birthday, lent him money when he was a little short before payday--not
that he ever remembered paying them back--and they never demanded anything in
return. All this, and I was an ungrateful bastard, he concluded. I took everything for
granted.
To his credit, he'd never cheated on any of them. But let them complain a little,
try to win an argument, show a bit of jealousy, urge him to save some money, get a little
overwrought, or express even a hint of worry about the future, and he was out of there.
He always figured the most important thing about girls was to avoid any sticky
situations, so all it took was one tiny wave to rock the boat and he was gone. He'd find a
new girl and start over. He was sure most people did the same.
"If I were a girl," he said to the stone, "and was going out with a self-centered
bastard like me, I'd blow my stack. I'm sure of it, now that I look back on it. I don't
know how they all put up with me for so long. It's amazing." He lit a Marlboro and,
slowly exhaling smoke, rubbed the stone with one hand. "Am I right or what? I'm not so
good-looking, no great shakes in bed. Don't have much money. Not such a great
personality, not too bright. A lot of negatives here. Son of a poor farmer from the sticks,
a no-good ex-soldier-turned-truck-driver. When I think back on it, though, I was really
lucky when it came to girls. I wasn't very popular, but I always had a girlfriend.
Someone who let me sleep with her, who fed me, lent me money. But you know
something? Good things don't last forever. I feel that more and more as time goes by. It's
like somebody's saying, Hey, Hoshino, someday you're gonna have to pay up."
He rubbed the stone while relating his amorous adventures. He'd gotten so used to
rubbing it that he didn't want to stop. At noon a school chime rang out, and he went to
the kitchen to make a bowl of udon, adding some scallions along with a raw egg. After
lunch he listened again to the Archduke Trio.
"Hey, stone," he called out right after the first movement ended. "Pretty nice
music, huh? Really makes you feel like your heart's opening up, don't you think?"
The stone was silent.
He had no idea if the stone was listening, to the music or to him, but he forged
ahead anyway. "Like I was saying this morning, I've done some awful things in my life.
I was pretty self-centered. And it's too late to erase it all now, you know? But when I
listen to this music it's like Beethoven's right here talking to me, telling me something
like, It's okay, Hoshino, don't worry about it. That's life. I've done some pretty awful
things in my life too. Not much you can do about it. Things happen. You just got to
hang in there. Beethoven being the guy he was, he's not about to say anything like that.
But I'm still picking up that vibe from his music, like that's what it's saying to me. Can
you feel it?"
The stone was mute.
"Whatever," Hoshino said. "That's just my opinion. I'll shut up so we can listen."
When he looked outside at two, a fat black cat was sitting on the railing on the
veranda, gazing in at the apartment. Bored, Hoshino opened the window and called out,
"Hey there, kitty. Nice day, isn't it?"
"Yes, indeed, it is a fine day, Mr. Hoshino," the cat replied.
"Gimme a break," Hoshino said, shaking his head.
The Boy Named Crow
The boy named Crow flew in large, languid circles above the forest. After inscribing one,
he'd fly off to another spot and carefully begin another, identical circle, each invisible
circle following another in the air only to vanish. Like a reconnaissance plane, he
scanned the forest below him, looking for someone he couldn't seem to locate. Like a
huge ocean, the forest undulated beneath him and spread to the horizon in a thick,
anonymous cloak of interlaced branches. The sky was covered with gray clouds, and
there was neither wind nor sunlight. At this point the boy named Crow had to be the
loneliest bird in the world, but he was too busy to think about that now.
He finally spotted an opening in the sea of trees below and shot straight down
through it to an open piece of ground. The light shone on a small patch of ground that
was marked with grass. In one corner of the clearing was a large round rock and a man
in a bright red sweat suit and a black silk hat was sitting on it. He wore thick-soled
hiking boots, and a khaki-colored bag lay on the ground beside him. A strange getup,
though the boy named Crow didn't mind. This was who he was after. What the man had
on was of little consequence.
The man looked up at the sudden flapping of wings and saw Crow land on a large
branch. "Hey," he said cheerfully.
The boy named Crow didn't make any reply. Resting on the branch, he gazed,
unblinking, expressionless, at the man. Occasionally he'd incline his head to one side.
"I know who you are," the man said. He doffed his hat and put it back on. "I had a
feeling you'd be coming here before long." He cleared his throat, frowned, and spat on
the ground, then stamped the spit into the dirt with his boot.
"I was just resting, and feeling a bit bored with no one to talk to. How about
coming over here? We can have a nice little talk. What do you say? I've never seen you
before, but that doesn't mean we're total strangers."
The boy named Crow kept his mouth shut, holding his wings close in against
himself.
The man in the silk hat lightly shook his head. "Ah, I see. You can't speak, can
you? No matter. I'll do the talking, if you don't mind. I know what you're going to do,
even if you don't say a word. You don't want me to go any further, do you? It's so
obvious I can predict what'll happen. You don't want me to go any further, but that's
exactly what I want to do. Because it's a golden opportunity I can't let slip through my
fingers--a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
He gave the ankle of his hiking boots a good slap. "To leap to the conclusion here,
you won't be able to stop me. You aren't qualified. Let's say I play my flute, what's
going to happen? You won't be able to come any closer to me. That's the power of my
flute. You might not know this, but it's a unique kind of flute, not just some ordinary,
everyday instrument. And actually I've got quite a few here in my bag."
The man reached out and carefully patted the bag, then looked up again at the boy
named Crow perched on his branch. "I made this flute out of the souls of cats I've
collected. Cut out the souls of cats while they were still alive and made them into this
flute. I felt sorry for the cats, of course, cutting them up like that, but I couldn't help it.
This flute is beyond any world's standards of good and evil, love or hatred. Making
these flutes has been my longtime calling, and I've always done a decent job of fulfilling
my role and doing my bit. Nothing to be ashamed of. I got married, had children, and
made more than enough flutes. So I'm not going to make any more. Just between you
and me, I'm thinking of taking all the flutes I've made and creating a much larger, far
more powerful flute out of them--a super-size flute that becomes a system unto itself.
Right now I'm heading to a place where I can construct that kind of flute. I'm not the one
who decides whether that flute turns out to be good or evil, and neither are you. It all
depends on when and where I am. In that sense I'm a man totally without prejudices, like
history or the weather--completely unbiased. And since I am, I can transform into a kind
of system."
He removed his silk hat, rubbed the thinning hair on top of his head, put the hat
back on, and quickly adjusted the brim. "Once I play this flute, getting rid of you will be
a snap. The thing is, I don't feel like playing it right now. It takes a lot out of me, and I
don't want to waste any strength. I'll need all of it later on. But whether I play the flute
or not, you can't stop me. That should be obvious."
The man cleared his throat once more, and rubbed the slight swell of his belly.
"Do you know what limbo is? It's the neutral point between life and death. A kind of sad,
gloomy place. Where I am now, in other words--this forest. I died, at my own bidding,
but haven't gone on to the next world. I'm a soul in transition, and a soul in transition is
formless. I've merely adopted this form for the time being. That's why you can't hurt me.
You follow me? Even if I were to bleed all over the place, it's not real blood. Even if I
were to suffer horribly, it's not real suffering. The only one who could wipe me out right
now is someone who's qualified to do so. And--sad to say--you don't fit the bill. You're
nothing more than an immature, mediocre illusion. No matter how determined you may
be, eliminating me's impossible for the likes of you." The man looked at the boy named
Crow and beamed. "How 'bout it? Want to give it a try?"
As if that was the signal he'd been waiting for, the boy named Crow spread his
wings wide, leaped off the branch, and darted straight at him. He seized the man's chest
with both talons, drew his head back, and brought his beak down on the man's right eye,
pecking away fiendishly like he was hacking away with a pickax, his jet black wings
flapping noisily all the while. The man put up no resistance, didn't lift a finger to protect
himself. He didn't cry out, either. Instead, he laughed out loud. His hat fell to the ground,
and his eyeball was soon shredded and hanging from its socket. The boy named Crow
tenaciously attacked the other eye now. Once both eyes were replaced by vacant cavities,
he turned immediately to the man's face, pecking away, slashing it all over. His face was
soon cut to ribbons, pieces of skin flying off, blood spurting out, nothing more than a
lump of reddish flesh. Crow next attacked the top of his head, where the hair was
thinnest, and still the man kept on laughing. The more vicious the attack became, the
louder he laughed, as if the whole situation was so hilarious he couldn't control himself.
The man never took his eyes--now vacant sockets--off Crow, and in between
laughs managed to choke out a few words. "See, what'd I tell you? Don't make me laugh.
You can try all you want, but it's not going to hurt me. You're not qualified to do that.
You're just a flimsy illusion, a cheap echo. It's useless, no matter what you do. Don't you
get it?"
The boy named Crow stabbed at the mouth these words had come from. His huge
wings ceaselessly beat at the air, a few shiny black feathers coming loose, swirling in
the air like fragments of a soul. Crow tore at the man's tongue, grabbed it with his beak,
and yanked with all his might. It was long and hugely thick, and once it was pulled out
from deep within the man's throat, it squirmed like a gigantic mollusk, forming dark
words. Without a tongue, however, not even this man could laugh anymore. He looked
like he couldn't breathe, either, but still he held his sides and shook with soundless
laughter. The boy named Crow listened, and this unheard laughter--as vacant and
ominous as wind blowing over a far-off desert--never ceased. It sounded, in fact, very
much like an otherworldly flute.
Chapter 47
I wake up just after dawn, boil water on the electric hot plate, and make some tea. I sit
down beside the window to see what, if anything, is going on outside. Everything is
dead quiet, with no sign of anybody on the street. Even the birds seem reluctant to
launch into their usual morning chorus. The hills to the east are barely edged in a faint
light. The place is surrounded by high hills, which explains why dawn comes so late and
twilight so early. I go over to the nightstand where my watch is to check the time, but
the digital screen's a complete blank. When I push a few buttons at random, nothing
happens. The batteries should still be good, but for some unfathomable reason the thing
stopped while I was sleeping. I put the watch back on top of my pillow and rub my left
wrist, where I normally wear it, with my right. Not that time's much of a factor here.
As I gaze at the vacant, birdless scene outside, I suddenly want to read a book--
any book. As long as it's shaped like a book and has printing, it's fine by me. I just want
to hold a book in my hands, turn the pages, scan the words with my eyes. Only one
problem--there isn't a book in sight. In fact, it's like printing hasn't been invented here. I
quickly look around the room, and sure enough, there's nothing at all with any writing
on it.
I open the chest of drawers in the bedroom to see what kind of clothes are inside.
Everything's neatly folded. None of the clothes are new. The colors are faded, the
material soft from countless washings. Still, they look clean. There's round-neck shirts,
underwear, socks, cotton shirts with collars, and cotton trousers. Not a perfect fit, but
pretty much my size. All the clothes are perfectly plain and design-free, like the whole
idea of clothes with patterns never existed. None of them have any makers' labels--so
much for any writing there. I exchange my smelly T-shirt for a gray one from the drawer
that smells like sunlight and soap.
A while later--how much later I couldn't say--the girl arrives. She taps lightly on
the door and, without waiting for an answer, opens it. The door doesn't have any kind of
lock. Her canvas bag is slung over her shoulder. The sky behind her is already light.
She goes straight to the kitchen and cooks some eggs in a small black frying pan.
There's a pleasant sizzle as the eggs hit the hot oil, and the fresh cooking smells waft
through the room. Meanwhile, she toasts some bread in a squat little toaster that looks
like a prop from an old movie. Her clothes and hair are the same as the night before--a
light blue dress, hair pinned back. Her skin is so smooth and beautiful, and her slim,
porcelain-like arms glisten in the morning sun. Through the open window a tiny bee
buzzes in, as if to make the world a little more complete. The girl carries the food over
to the table, sits in a chair, and watches me eat the vegetable omelette and buttered toast
and drink some herb tea. She doesn't eat or drink anything. The whole thing's a repeat of
last night.
"Don't people here cook their own meals?" I ask her. "I was wondering because
you're making meals for me."
"Some people make their own, others have somebody make meals for them," she
replies. "Mostly, though, people here don't eat very much."
"Really?"
She nods. "Sometimes they eat. When they want to."
"You mean no one else eats as much as I do?"
"Can you get by without eating for one whole day?"
I shake my head.
"Folks here often go a whole day without eating, no problem. They actually
forget to eat, sometimes for days at a time."
"I'm not used to things here yet, so I have to eat."
"I suppose so," she says. "That's why I'm cooking for you."
I look in her face. "How long will it take for me to get used to this place?"
"How long?" she parrots, and slowly shakes her head. "I have no idea. It's not a
question of time. When that time comes, you'll already be used to it."
We're sitting across from each other, her hands neatly lined up on the table, palms
down. Her ten little resolute fingers are there, real objects before me. Directly across
from her, I catch each tiny flutter of her eyelashes, count each blink of her eyes, watch
the strands of hair swaying over her forehead. I can't take my eyes off her.
"That time?" I say.
"It isn't like you'll cut something out of yourself and throw it away," she says.
"We don't throw it away--we accept it, inside us."
"And I'll accept this inside of me?"
"That's right."
"And then?" I ask. "After I accept it, then what happens?"
She inclines her head slightly as she thinks, an utterly natural gesture. The strands
of hair sway again. "Then you'll become completely yourself," she says.
"So you mean up till now I haven't been completely me?"
"You are totally yourself even now," she says, then thinks it over. "What I mean
is a little different. But I can't explain it well."
"You can't understand until it actually happens?"
She nods.
When it gets too painful to watch her anymore, I close my eyes. Then I open them
right away, to make sure she's still there. "Is it sort of a communal lifestyle here?"
She considers this. "Everyone does live together, and share certain things. Like
the shower rooms, the electrical station, the market. There are certain simple, unspoken
agreements in place, but nothing complicated. Nothing you need to think about, or even
put into words. So there isn't anything I need to teach you about how things are done.
The most important thing about life here is that people let themselves be absorbed into
things. As long as you do that, there won't be any problems."
"What do you mean by absorbed?"
"It's like when you're in the forest, you become a seamless part of it. When you're
in the rain, you're a part of the rain. When you're in the morning, you're a seamless part
of the morning. When you're with me, you become a part of me."
"When you're with me, then, you're a seamless part of me?"
"That's true."
"What does it feel like? To be yourself and part of me at the same time?"
She looks straight at me and touches her hairpin. "It's very natural. Once you're
used to it, it's quite simple. Like flying."
"You can fly?"
"Just an example," she says, and smiles. It's a smile without any deep or hidden
meaning, a smile for the sake of smiling. "You can't know what flying feels like until
you actually do it. It's the same."
"So it's a natural thing you don't even have to think about?"
She nods. "Yes, it's quite natural, calm, quiet, something you don't have to think
about. It's seamless."
"Am I asking too many questions?"
"Not at all," she replies. "I only wish I could explain things better."
"Do you have memories?"
Again she shakes her head and rests her hands on the table, this time with the
palms faceup. She glances at them expressionlessly.
"No, I don't. In a place where time isn't important, neither is memory. Of course I
remember last night, coming here and making vegetable stew. And you ate it all, didn't
you? The day before that I remember a bit of. But anything before that, I don't know.
Time has been absorbed inside me, and I can't distinguish between one object and
whatever's beside it."
"So memory isn't so important here?"
She beams. "That's right. Memory isn't so important here. The library handles
memories."
After the girl leaves, I sit by the window holding my hand out in the morning sun,
its shadow falling on the windowsill, a distinct five-finger outline. The bee stops
buzzing around and quietly lands above the windowpane. It seems to have some serious
thinking to do. And so do I.
When the sun is a little bit past its highest point, she comes to where I'm staying,
knocks lightly, and opens the door. For a moment I can't tell who I'm looking at--the
young girl or her. A slight shift in light, or the way the wind blows, is all it takes for her
to change completely. It's like in one instant she transforms into the young girl, a
moment later changing back into Miss Saeki. Not that this really takes place. The person
in front of me is, without a doubt, Miss Saeki and no other.
"Hello," she says in a natural tone of voice, just like when we passed in the
corridor of the library. She's wearing a long-sleeved navy blue blouse and a matching
knee-length skirt, a thin silver necklace, and small pearl earrings--exactly as I'm used to
seeing her. Her high heels make short, dry clicks as she steps onto the porch, a sound
that's slightly out of place here. She stands gazing at me from the doorway, as if she's
checking to see whether it's the real me or not. Of course it's the real me. Just like she's
the real Miss Saeki.
"How about coming in for a cup of tea?" I say.
"I'd like that," she says. And, like she's finally worked up the nerve, she steps
inside.
I go to the kitchen and turn on the stove to boil water, trying to get my breathing
back to normal.
She sits down at the dining table in the same chair the girl had just been sitting in.
"It feels like we're back in the library, doesn't it?" she says.
"Sure does," I agree. "Except for no coffee, and no Oshima."
"And not a book in sight," she says.
I make two cups of herbal tea and carry them out to the table, sitting across from
her. Birds chirp outside the open window. The bee's still napping above the windowpane.
Miss Saeki's the first one to speak. "I want you to know it wasn't easy for me to
come here. But I had to see you, and talk with you."
I nod. "I'm glad you came."
Her trademark smile plays around her lips. "There's something I have to tell you."
Her smile's nearly identical to the young girl's, though with a bit more depth, a slight
nuance that moves me.
She wraps her hands around the teacup. I'm gazing at the tiny pearl piercings in
her ears. She's thinking, and it's taking her longer than usual.
"I burned up all my memories," she says, deliberately choosing her words. "They
went up in smoke and disappeared into the air. So I won't be able to remember things for
very long. All sorts of things--including my time with you. That's why I wanted to see
you and talk with you as soon as I could. While I can still remember."
I crane my neck and look up at the bee above the window, its little black shadow
a single dot on the sill.
"The most important thing," she says quietly, "is you've got to get out of here. As
fast as you can. Leave here, go through the woods, and back to the life you left. The
entrance is going to close soon. Promise me you will."
I shake my head. "You don't understand this, Miss Saeki, but I don't have any
world to go back to. No one's ever really loved me, or wanted me, my entire life. I don't
know who to count on other than myself. For me, the idea of a life I left is meaningless."
"But you still have to go back."
"Even if there's nothing there? Even if nobody cares if I'm there or not?"
"That's not why," she says. "It's what I want. For you to be there."
"But you're not there, are you?"
She looks down at her hands clasping the teacup. "No, I'm not. I'm not there
anymore."
"What do you want from me if I do go back?"
"Just one thing," she says, raising her head and looking me straight in the eye. "I
want you to remember me. If you remember me, then I don't care if everybody else
forgets."
Silence descends on us for a time. A profound silence.
A question wells up inside me, a question so big it plugs up my throat and makes
it hard to breathe. I somehow swallow it back, finally choosing another. "Are memories
such an important thing?"
"It depends," she replies, and lightly closes her eyes. "In some cases they're the
most important thing there is."
"Yet you burned yours up."
"I had no use for them anymore." Miss Saeki brings her hands together on the
table, her palms down the way the young girl's were the first time. "Kafka? I have a
favor to ask. I want you to take that painting with you."
"You mean the one in my room in the library? The painting of the shore?"
Miss Saeki nods. "Yes, Kafka on the Shore. I want you to take it. Where, I don't
care. Wherever you're going."
"But doesn't it belong to somebody?"
She shakes her head. "It's mine. He gave it to me as a present when he went away
to college in Tokyo. Ever since then I've had it with me. Wherever I lived, I always hung
it on the wall in my room. When I started working at the Komura Library I put it back in
that room, where it first hung, but that was just temporary. I left a letter for Oshima in
my desk in the library telling him I wanted you to have the painting. After all, the
painting is originally yours."
"Mine?"
She nods. "You were there. And I was there beside you, watching you. On the
shore, a long time ago. The wind was blowing, there were white puffy clouds, and it was
always summer."
I close my eyes. I'm at the beach and it's summer. I'm lying back on a deck chair.
I can feel the roughness of its canvas on my skin. I breathe in deeply the smell of the sea
and the tide. Even with my eyes closed, the sun is glaring. I can hear the sound of the
waves lapping at the shore. The sound recedes, then draws closer, as if time is making it
quiver. Nearby, someone is painting a picture of me. And beside him sits a young girl in
a short-sleeved light blue dress, gazing in my direction. She has straight hair, a straw hat
with a white ribbon, and she's scooping up the sand. Steady, long fingers--the fingers of
a pianist. Her smooth-as-porcelain arms glisten in the sunlight. A natural-looking smile
plays at her lips. I'm in love with her. And she's in love with me.
That's the memory.
"I want you to have that painting with you forever," Miss Saeki says. She stands
up, goes to the window, and looks outside. The sun's still high in the sky. The bee's still
asleep. Miss Saeki holds up a hand to shield her eyes and looks at something far off,
then turns to face me. "You have to go," she says.
I go over to her. Her ear brushes against my neck, the earring hard against my
skin. I rest both palms on her back like I'm deciphering some sign there. Her hair
brushes my cheek. She holds me tight, her fingers digging hard into my back. Fingers
clinging to the wall that's time. The smell of the sea, the sound of waves breaking on the
shore. Someone calling my name from far, far away.
"Are you my mother?" I'm finally able to ask.
"You already know the answer to that," Miss Saeki says.
She's right--I do know the answer. But neither one of us can put it into words.
Putting it into words will destroy any meaning.
"A long time ago I abandoned someone I shouldn't have," she says. "Someone I
loved more than anything else. I was afraid someday I'd lose this person. So I had to let
go myself. If he was going to be stolen away from me, or I was going to lose him by
accident, I decided it was better to discard him myself. Of course I felt anger that didn't
fade, that was part of it. But the whole thing was a huge mistake. It was someone I
should never have abandoned."
I listen in silence.
"You were discarded by the one person who never should have done that," Miss
Saeki says. "Kafka--do you forgive me?"
"Do I have the right to?"
She looks at my shoulder and nods several times. "As long as anger and fear don't
prevent you."
"Miss Saeki, if I really do have the right to, then yes--I do forgive you," I tell her.
Mother, you say. I forgive you. And with those words, audibly, the frozen part of
your heart crumbles.
Silently, she lets go of me. She takes the hairpin out of her hair and without a
moment's hesitation stabs the sharp tip into the inner flesh of her left arm, hard. With her
right hand she presses down tightly on a vein, and blood begins to seep out. The first
drop plops audibly to the floor. Without a word she holds her arm out toward me.
Another drop of blood falls to the floor.
I bend over and put my lips on the small wound, lick her blood with my tongue,
close my eyes, and savor the taste. I hold the blood in my mouth and slowly swallow it.
Her blood goes down, deep in my throat. It's quietly absorbed by the dry outer layer of
my heart. Only now do I understand how much I've wanted that blood. My mind is
someplace far away, though my body is still right here--just like a living spirit. I feel like
sucking down every last drop of blood from her, but I can't. I take my lips off her arm
and look into her face.
"Farewell, Kafka Tamura," Miss Saeki says. "Go back to where you belong, and
live."
"Miss Saeki?" I ask.
"Yes?"
"I don't know what it means to live."
She lets me go and looks up at me. She reaches out and touches my lips. "Look at
the painting," she says quietly. "Keep looking at the painting, just like I did."
And she leaves. She opens the door and, without glancing back, steps outside and
closes the door. I stand at the window and watch her go. Quickly she vanishes in the
shadow of a building. Hands resting on the sill, I gaze for the longest time at where she
disappeared. Maybe she forgot to say something and will come back. But she never does.
All that's left is an absence, like a hollow.
The dozing bee wakes up and buzzes around me for a while. Then, as if finally
remembering what it's supposed to be doing, it flies out the open window. The sun
shines down. I go back to the table and sit down. Her cup is sitting there, with a bit of
tea left in it. I leave it where it is, without touching it. The cup looks like a metaphor. A
metaphor of memories that, before long, will be lost.
I take off my shirt and change back into my sweaty, smelly T-shirt. I put the dead
watch back on my left wrist. Then I put the ball cap Oshima gave me on backward, and
the pair of sky blue sunglasses. Finally I tug on my long-sleeved shirt. I walk into the
kitchen and drink a glass of tap water, put the glass in the sink, and take a final look
around the room. At the dining table, the chairs. The chair the girl and Miss Saeki sat on.
The teacup on top of the table. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. You already
know the answer to that.
I open the door, go outside, and close the door. I walk down the porch steps, my
shadow falling distinct and clear on the ground. It looks like it's clinging to my feet. The
sun's still high in the sky.
At the entrance to the forest the two soldiers are leaning against a tree trunk like
they've been waiting for me. When they see me they don't ask a single question. It's as if
they already know what I'm thinking. Their rifles are slung over their shoulders.
The tall soldier is chewing on a stalk of grass. "The entrance is still open," he says.
"At least it was when I checked a minute ago."
"You don't mind if we keep the same pace as before?" the brawny one asks. "You
can keep up?"
"No problem. I can keep up."
"It'll be a problem, though, if we get there and the entrance is already shut," the
tall one comments.
"Then you're stuck here," his companion adds.
"I know," I say.
"No regrets at having to leave?" the tall one asks.
"None."
"Then let's get going."
"Better not look behind you," the brawny one says.
"Yeah, that's a good idea," the tall one says.
And once again I set off through the forest.
Once, as we're hurrying up a slope, I do glance back. The soldiers warned me not
to, but I couldn't help it. This is the last spot you can see the town from. Beyond it we'll
be cut off by a wall of trees, and that world will vanish from my sight forever.
There still isn't a soul on the street. A beautiful stream runs through the hollow,
small buildings line the street, the electric poles casting dark shadows on the ground. For
a moment I'm frozen to the spot. I have to go back, no matter what. I could at least stay
there until evening, when the young girl with the canvas bag will visit me. If you need
me, I'll be there. I get a hot lump in my chest and a powerful magnet's pulling me back
toward the town. My feet are buried in lead and won't budge. If I go on I'll never see her
again. I come to a halt. I've lost all sense of time. I want to call out to the soldiers in
front of me, I'm not going back, I'm staying. But no voice comes out. Words have no life
in them.
I'm caught between one void and another. I have no idea what's right, what's
wrong. I don't even know what I want anymore. I'm standing alone in the middle of a
horrific sandstorm. I can't move, and can't even see my fingertips anymore. Sand as
white as pulverized bones wraps me in its grip. But I hear her--Miss Saeki--speaking to
me. "No matter what, you have to go back," she says decisively. "It's what I want. For
you to be there."
The spell is broken, and I'm in one piece again. Warm blood returns to my body.
The blood she gave me, the last drops of blood she had. The next instant I'm facing
forward and following the soldiers. I turn a corner and that little world in the hills
vanishes, swallowed up in dreams. Now I just focus on making it through the forest
without getting lost. Not wandering from the path. That's what's important now, what I
have to do.
The entrance is still open. There's still time until evening. I thank the two soldiers.
They lay down their rifles and, like before, sit down on the large flat rock. The tall
soldier's still chewing on a bit of grass. They're not out of breath at all after our
breathless rush through the woods.
"Don't forget what I told you about bayonets," the tall soldier says. "When you
stab the enemy, you've got to twist and slash, to cut his guts open. Otherwise he'll do it
to you. That's the way the world is outside."
"That's not all there is, though," the brawny one says.
"No, of course not," the tall one replies, and clears his throat. "I'm just talking
about the dark side of things."
"It's also real hard to tell right from wrong," the brawny one says.
"But it's something you've got to do," the tall one adds.
"Most likely," the brawny one says.
"One more thing," the tall one says. "Once you leave here, don't ever look back
until you reach your destination. Not even once, do you understand?"
"This is important," the brawny one adds.
"Somehow you made it through back there," the tall one says, "but this time it's
serious. Until you get to where you're going, don't ever look back."
"Ever," the brawny one says.
"I understand," I tell them. I thank them again and say good-bye.
The two of them come to attention and salute. I'll never see them again. I know
that. And they know that. And knowing this, we say farewell.
I don't recall much of how I got back to Oshima's cabin after leaving the soldiers.
As I made my way through the thick forest my mind must have been elsewhere.
Amazingly, I didn't get lost. I have a vague memory of spotting the daypack I'd thrown
away and, without thinking, picking it up. Same with the compass, the hatchet, the can
of spray paint. I remember seeing the yellow marks I'd sprayed on tree trunks, like
scales left behind by some giant moth.
I stand in the clearing in front of the cabin and gaze up at the sky. The world
around me is suddenly filled with brilliant sounds--birds chirping, water gurgling down
the stream, wind rustling the leaves. All faint, but to me it's like corks have been pulled
from my ears and now everything sounds so alive, so warm, so close. Everything's
mixed together, but still I can make out each individual sound. I look down at the watch
on my wrist, and it's working again. Digital numbers flash on the green screen, changing
each minute like nothing had ever happened. It's 4:16.
I go into the cabin and lie down on the bed in my clothes. I'm exhausted. I lie
there on my back and close my eyes. A bee is resting above the window. The girl's arms
glisten in the sunlight like porcelain. "An example," she says.
"Look at the painting," Miss Saeki says. "Just like I did."
White sands of time slip through the girl's slim fingers. Waves crash softly
against the shore. They rise up, fall, and break. Rise up, fall, and break. And my
consciousness is sucked into a dim, dark corridor.
Chapter 48
Gimme a break," Hoshino repeated.
Nothing's about to break here, Mr. Hoshino," the black cat said wearily. The cat
had a large face and looked old. "I figured you were bored all by yourself. Talking to a
stone all day."
"But how can you speak human language?"
"I can't."
"I don't get it. How are we able to carry on a conversation like this? A human and
a cat?"
"We're on the border of this world, speaking a common language. That's all."
Hoshino gave this some thought. "The border of the world? A common
language?"
"It's all right if you don't understand. I could explain, but it's a long story," the cat
said, giving a couple of short, dismissive flips of its tail.
"Wait a sec!" Hoshino said. "You're Colonel Sanders, aren't you?"
"Colonel who?" the cat said sullenly. "I don't know who you're talking about. I'm
me, and nobody else. Just your friendly neighborhood cat."
"Do you have a name?"
"Sure I do."
"What is it?"
"Toro," the cat replied hesitantly.
"Toro?" Hoshino repeated. "Like the real expensive part of tuna, you mean?"
"Correct," the cat replied. "The local sushi chef owns me. They have a dog, too.
They call him Tekka. Tuna Roll."
"Do you know my name, then?"
"You're pretty famous, Mr. Hoshino," Toro replied, and smiled.
Hoshino had never seen a cat smile before. The smile quickly faded, though, and
the cat went back to its usual docile expression.
"Cats know everything," Toro said. "I know that Mr. Nakata died yesterday, and
that there's a valuable stone over there. I've lived a long life and know everything that's
happened around here."
"Hmm," Hoshino murmured, impressed. "Hey, instead of us just shooting the
breeze out here, why don't you come inside, Toro?"
Lying on the railing, the cat shook its head. "No, I'm fine here. I wouldn't be able
to relax inside. Besides, it's a nice day out, so why don't we just talk here?"
"Fine by me," Hoshino said. "Say, are you hungry? I'm sure we have something
to eat."
Again the cat shook his head. "Thanks, but I'm all set for food. In fact, keeping
my weight down's more of a problem. If your owner runs a sushi shop, you tend to have
a bit of a cholesterol problem. Jumping up and down's not easy when you're carrying
some excess pounds."
"Well, tell me then, Toro, is there some reason you're here?"
"There is," the black cat said. "I thought you might be having a hard time dealing
with that stone all alone."
"You got that right. Definitely. I'm in kind of a bind here."
"I thought I'd lend you a hand."
"That would be great," Hoshino said. "Take a paws in your schedule, huh?"
"The stone's the problem," Toro said, shaking his head to get rid of a buzzing fly.
"Once you get the stone back the way it belongs, your job's over. You can go wherever
you want after that. Do I have that right?"
"Yup, you got it. Once I get the stone closed that's all she wrote. Like Mr. Nakata
said, once you open something up you got to close it. That's the rule."
"That's why I thought I'd show you what to do."
"You know what I should do?" Hoshino asked, excited.
"Of course," the cat said. "What'd I tell you? Cats know everything. Not like
dogs."
"So what should I do?"
"You have to kill it," the cat said soberly.
"Kill it?" Hoshino said.
"That's right. You've got to kill it."
"Who is this it you're talking about?"
"You'll know it when you see it," the black cat explained. "Until you actually see
it, though, you won't understand what I mean. It doesn't have any real form to begin with.
It changes shape, depending on the situation."
"Is this a person we're talking about?"
"No, it's no person. That's for certain."
"So what does it look like?"
"You got me," Toro said. "Didn't I just explain? That you'll know it when you see
it, and if you don't you won't? What about that don't you understand?"
Hoshino sighed. "So what is this thing's real identity?"
"You don't need to know that," the cat said. "It's hard to explain. Or maybe I
should say you're better off not knowing. Anyhow, right now it's biding its time. Lying
in some dark place, breathing quietly, watching and waiting. But it's not going to wait
forever. Sooner or later it'll make its move. I'm figuring today is the day. And it will
most definitely pass in front of you. It's an opportune moment."
"Opportune?"
"A one-in-a-million chance," the black cat said. "All you have to do is wait and
kill it. That will put an end to it. Then you're free to go wherever you like."
"Isn't that against the law?"
"I wouldn't know about the law," Toro said, "being a cat and all. Since it's not a
person, though, I doubt the law has anything to do with it. Anyhow, it's got to be killed.
Even your typical cat next door like me can see that."
"Okay, say I want to kill it--how am I supposed to do it? I don't have any idea
how big it is or what it looks like. Hard to plan a murder when you don't know the basic
facts about the victim."
"It's up to you. Smash it with a hammer if you like. Stab it with a carving knife.
Strangle it. Burn it. Bite it to death. Whatever works for you--but the main thing is
you've got to kill it. Liquidate it with extreme prejudice. You were in the Self-Defense
Force, am I right? Used taxpayers' money to learn how to shoot a rifle? How to sharpen
a bayonet? You're a soldier, so use your head and figure out the best way to kill it."
"What I learned in the SDF was what to do in a war," Hoshino protested weakly.
"They never trained me to ambush and kill something whose size and shape I don't even
know--with a hammer, no less."
"It'll be trying to get in through the entrance," Toro went on, ignoring Hoshino's
protests. "But you can't let it--no matter what. You've got to make sure you kill it before
it gets inside the entrance. Got it? Let it slip by you, and that's the end."
"A one-in-a-million chance."
"Exactly," Toro said. "Though that's just a figure of speech."
"But isn't this thing pretty dangerous?" Hoshino asked fearfully. "It might turn the
tables on me."
"It's probably not all that dangerous when it's on the move," the cat said. "Once it
stops moving, though, watch out. That's when it's dangerous. So when it's on the move,
don't let it get away. That's when you've got to finish it off."
"Probably?" Hoshino said.
The black cat didn't reply to that. He narrowed his eyes, stretched on the guardrail,
and slowly got to his feet. "I'll be seeing you, Mr. Hoshino. Remember to kill it. If you
don't do that, Mr. Nakata will never rest in peace. You liked the old man, didn't you?"
"Yeah. He was a good man."
"So you've got to kill it. Liquidate it with extreme prejudice, as I said. Mr. Nakata
would've wanted you to. So do it for him. You've taken on his role now. You've always
been a happy-go-lucky type, never taking responsibility for anything, right? Now's the
chance to make up for that. Don't blow it, okay? I'll be rooting for you."
"That's encouraging," Hoshino said. "Oh, hey--I just thought of something."
"What?"
"Maybe the entrance stone is still open to lure it in?"
"Could be," Toro said diffidently. "One more thing. It only makes a move very
late at night. So you should sleep during the day to make sure you don't fall asleep late
and let it get away. That would be a catastrophe."
The black cat leaped nimbly onto the roof next door, straightened his tail, and
walked away. For such a huge cat he was light on his feet. Hoshino watched from the
veranda as the cat disappeared. Toro didn't look back even once.
"Man alive," Hoshino said, then went back into the kitchen to scout around for
potential weapons. He found an extremely sharp kitchen knife, plus another heavy knife
shaped like a hatchet. The kitchen had only a rudimentary assortment of pots and pans,
but quite a collection of knives. In addition he selected a large, hefty hammer and some
nylon rope. An ice pick rounded out his arsenal.
Here's where a nice automatic rifle would come in handy, he thought as he
rummaged around the kitchen. He had been trained to shoot automatic rifles in the SDF,
and was a decent marksman. Not that he expected to find a rifle in a cupboard
somewhere. If anybody ever shot off an automatic rifle in a quiet neighborhood like this,
there'd be hell to pay.
He laid all his weapons down on the living-room table--the two knives, ice pick,
hammer, and rope. He put a flashlight beside them, then sat down next to the stone and
began rubbing it.
"Jeez," Hoshino said to the stone. "A hammer and knives to fight something, and
I don't even know what it is? With a black cat from the neighborhood calling the shots?
What the hell kind of deal is this?"
The stone, of course, withheld comment.
"Toro said it probably wasn't dangerous. Probably? But what if something out of
Jurassic Park springs up? What the hell am I supposed to do then, huh? I'd be a goner."
No response.
Hoshino grabbed the hammer and swung it around a few times.
"If you think about it, it's all fate. From the time I picked up Mr. Nakata at the rest
area till now, it's like fate decided everything. The only one who hasn't had a clue has
been me. Fate is one strange thing, man," Hoshino said. "Right? What's your take on it?"
The stone maintained its stony silence.
"Well, what can you do, right? I'm the one who chose this path, and I've got to see
it through to the end. Kind of hard to imagine what repulsive thing's gonna pop out--but
I'm okay with that. Got to give it my best shot. Life's short, and I've had some good
times. Toro said this is a one-in-a-million chance. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to go out
in a blaze of glory. At least try to win one for the old guy. For Mr. Nakata."
The stone's silent vigil continued.
Hoshino did as the cat had told him and took a nap on the sofa in preparation for
the night. It felt strange to follow a cat's instructions, but once he did lie down he was
able to sleep soundly for an hour. In the evening he went into the kitchen, defrosted
some shrimp curry, and had it over rice. As it started to get dark, he sat down next to the
stone, knives and hammer in easy reach.
He turned off all the lights except for a small table lamp. That's best, he figured. It
only makes a move at night, he thought, so I might as well make it as dark as possible. I
want to wind this up soon, too--so if you're out there, show your face! Let's get it over
with, okay? Once we're finished here I'm going back to Nagoya, to my apartment, and
call up some girl and get it on.
He no longer talked to the stone. He just waited there silently, glancing every so
often at the clock. When he got bored he'd swing the knife and hammer around. If
anything happens, he thought, it's got to be the middle of the night. Though of course it
might take place before that, and he wanted to make sure he didn't miss his chance--his
one-in-a-million chance. Now wasn't the time to slack off. Every once in a while he took
a bite of cracker and a sip of mineral water.
"Hey, stone," Hoshino whispered. "It's past midnight now--the time the demons
come out. The moment of truth. Let's you and me find out what's gonna happen, what
d'ya say?" He reached out to touch the stone. Maybe it was just his imagination, but the
surface seemed slightly warmer than usual. He rubbed it over and over, to buck up his
courage. "I want you to root for me too, okay?" he said to the stone. "I could do with a
little emotional support here."
It was a little after three a. m. when a faint rustling noise started to come from the
room where Nakata's body lay. A sound like something crawling along tatami. But there
weren't any tatami, because that room was carpeted.
Hoshino looked up and listened closely. No mistake about it, he thought, I don't
know what it is, but something's happening in there. His heart started to pound. He stuck
the hammer in his belt, grabbed the sharpest knife in his right hand, the flashlight in his
left, and stood up.
"Here we go...," he said to no one in particular.
He crept silently to the door to Nakata's room and opened it. He switched on the
flashlight and played it quickly around the body. That's definitely where the rustling had
come from. The beam illuminated a long, pale, thin object that was squirming out of
Nakata's mouth. The object reminded Hoshino of a gourd. It was as thick as a man's arm,
and though he couldn't tell how long it was, Hoshino guessed that about half of it was
out. Its wet body glistened like mucus. Nakata's mouth was stretched wide open like a
snake's, to let the thing out. His jaw must have been unhinged, it was so wide open.
Hoshino gulped loudly. His hand holding the flashlight was trembling a little, the
light wavering. Jeez, now how am I supposed to kill this thing? he wondered. It didn't
seem to have any arms or legs, eyes or nose. So slimy you can't even get a good grip. So
how am I supposed to liquidate it? And what the hell kind of creature is it, anyway?
Was it a kind of parasite that had been hiding inside Nakata all this time? Or was
it the old man's soul? No, that can't be it. His intuition told him that kind of creepy thing
couldn't have been inside Nakata. Even I know that much. It had to come from
somewhere else, and it's going through Mr. Nakata just to get inside the entrance. It
showed up when it wanted to, using Mr. Nakata as a kind of passageway for its own
purposes. And I can't let that happen. That's why I've got to kill it. Like the cat said,
liquidate it with extreme prejudice.
Hoshino went over to Nakata and quickly stabbed his knife into what seemed to
be the head of the thing. He pulled out the knife and stabbed again, over and over. But
there was little resistance to the knife, just the crisp feel you get when you plunge a
knife into a soft vegetable. Below the slimy exterior there was no flesh, no bones. No
organs, no brain. Once he pulled the blade out, the mucus covered up the wound right
away. No blood or liquid oozed out. It doesn't feel a thing, Hoshino thought. No matter
how fiercely he attacked it, the thing kept on creeping out of Nakata's mouth,
nonplussed.
Hoshino tossed the knife to the floor and went back to the living room and picked
up the heavy hatchet-shaped knife. He swung it down on the white thing over and over,
splitting the head open, but just as he thought, there was nothing inside--just the same
mushy white as the outer skin. He slashed at it a few times, finally severing part of the
head, which squirmed like a slug on the floor for a moment, then stopped moving like it
was dead. This had no effect on the rest of the body, which continued to ooze forward.
Mucus soon covered up the wound, swelling up so the thing looked the same as before.
None of this slowed it down as it wiggled on out of the old man's mouth.
Finally, the whole object was out, revealing its entire form. The creature was
about a yard long, with a tail, which finally allowed Hoshino to figure out for sure which
end was which. The tail was like a salamander's, short and thick, the tip abruptly
tapering down to a thin point. It had no legs, no eyes, no mouth or nose. But it most
definitely had a will of its own. No, Hoshino thought, it's more like a will is all it has.
He didn't need to figure that out logically, he just knew it. When it's on the move, he
thought, it just happens to take on this shape. A chill ran up his spine. Anyway, he
concluded, I've got to kill it.
He tried the hammer next, but it didn't do any good. He'd pound one part of the
creature only to see the surrounding flesh and mucus fill in the depression he'd made. He
carried over a small table and started bashing the thing with one of the legs, but nothing
slowed down its inexorable advance. Like some clumsy snake it slowly, steadily
crawled toward the next room and the entrance stone.
This isn't like any other living creature I've ever seen, Hoshino thought. No
weapon has any effect on it. There's no heart you can stab, no throat you can throttle. So
what the hell can I do? This thing is evil, and no matter what I've got to keep it from
getting into the entrance. Toro said I'd know it when I saw it, and damn if he isn't right. I
can't let this thing live.
Hoshino went back to the kitchen to look for something else to use as a weapon,
but couldn't find anything. Suddenly he looked down at the stone at his feet. The
entrance stone. That's it! I can use the stone to smash the thing. In the dim light the stone
had a more reddish cast to it than usual. He bent down and tried to lift it. It was terribly
heavy, and he couldn't budge it an inch. "I see--you're back to being the entrance stone,"
he said. "So if I close you up before that thing gets here, it won't be able to go inside."
Hoshino struggled with all his might to lift the stone, but couldn't.
"You're not moving," he said to the stone, gulping down big breaths. "I think
you're even heavier than before. You're a real ballbuster, you know that?"
Behind him the rustling sound continued. The white thing was steadily getting
closer and closer. He didn't have much time.
"One more try," Hoshino said. He rested his hands on the stone, took a huge
breath, filling his lungs, and held the air in. He focused all his energy on one spot and
put both hands on one side of the stone. If he couldn't lift it this time, he wouldn't have a
second chance. This is it, Hoshino! Now or never. I'm gonna do this if it kills me! With
all the strength he could muster he gave a groan and lifted. The stone raised up slightly.
He put his last ounce of energy into it and managed--like he was stripping the stone off
the floor--to lift it up.
His head felt faint and the muscles in his arms were screaming with pain. His
balls felt like they'd long since been busted. Still, he couldn't raise it any higher.
Hoshino thought of Nakata, how the old man had given his life to open and close the
stone. Somehow, some way, he had to see it through to the bitter end. Toro told him he
had to take over from the old man. His muscles were aching for fresh blood, his lungs
dying for air to make that blood, but he couldn't breathe. He knew he was about as close
to death as you can get, the abyss of nothingness gaping open right before his eyes. But
he ignored this, focused all his strength one last time, and pulled the stone toward him. It
lifted up and, with a massive thud, flipped over and fell to the floor. The floor shook
with the shock, the glass door rattling. The stone was tremendously, profoundly heavy.
Hoshino sat there gasping for air. "You did good," he told himself a few moments
later, once he finally caught his breath.
Once he'd closed the entrance, taking care of the white object was surprisingly
simple. It was shut out of where it was headed, and it knew it. It stopped its forward
advance and started crawling around the room looking for a place to hide, perhaps
hoping to crawl back inside Nakata's mouth. But it didn't have the strength to escape.
Hoshino went right after it, chopping it to pieces with his cleaver. Those pieces he
chopped into even tinier ones. These little bits writhed for a while on the floor, but soon
lost strength and stopped moving. They curled up into tight little balls and died, the
carpet glistening with their slime. Hoshino gathered all the pieces with a dustpan,
dumped them in a garbage bag that he tied closed with string, then put this bag inside
another that he also tied up tight. This he put inside a thick cloth bag he found in the
closet.
Completely drained, he squatted on the floor, his shoulders heaving as he took
deep breaths. His hands were shaking. He wanted to say something, but couldn't form
the words. "You did a good job, Hoshino," he managed to say a few moments later.
With all the noise he'd made attacking that white creature and flipping the stone
over, he was worried that people in the apartment building had woken up and were even
now dialing 911. Fortunately, nothing happened. No police sirens, no one pounding on
the door. The last thing he needed was for the police to come barging in.
Hoshino knew the bits and pieces of the white thing stuffed tightly in the bags
weren't about to come back to life. There's no place left for them to go, he thought. But
it was a good idea just to make sure, so he decided that as soon as it was light he'd go to
the beach and burn them all up. Turn them into ash.
And once that was over he'd head back to Nagoya. Back home.
It was nearly four by this time, and getting light out. Time to get going. Hoshino
stuffed his clothes into his bag, including--just to be on the safe side--his sunglasses and
Chunichi Dragons ball cap. Getting snagged by the police before he could finish would
mess up the whole thing. He took along a bottle of cooking oil to use to light the fire. He
remembered his CD of the Archduke Trio and tossed it in his bag as well.
Finally, he went into the room where Nakata lay in bed. The AC was still on full
blast, and the room was freezing. "Hey there, Mr. Nakata," he said, "I'm about ready to
take off. Sorry, but I can't stay here forever. I'll call the cops from the station so they can
come take care of your body. We'll just have to leave the rest up to some kind patrolmen,
okay? We'll never see each other again, but I'll never forget you. Even if I tried to, I
don't think I could."
With a loud rattle the air conditioner shut off.
"You know what, Gramps?" he went on. "I think that whenever something
happens in the future I'll always wonder--What would Mr. Nakata say about this? What
would Mr. Nakata do? I'll always have someone I can turn to. And that's kind of a big
deal, if you think about it. It's like part of you will always live inside me. Not that I'm
the best container you could find, but better than nothing, huh?"
But the person he was addressing was nothing more than a shell of Mr. Nakata.
The most important part of him had long since left for another place. And Hoshino
understood this.
"Hey there," he said to the stone, and reached out to touch its surface. It was back
to being just an ordinary stone, cool and rough to the touch. "I'm heading out. Going
back home to Nagoya. I'll have to let the cops take care of you too. I know I should take
you back to the shrine where you came from, but my memory isn't so good and I don't
have any idea which shrine it is. You'll have to forgive me. Don't put a curse on me or
anything, okay? I only did what Colonel Sanders told me to. So if you're gonna put a
curse on anybody, he's your guy. Anyhow, I'm happy I could meet you. I'll never forget
you, either."
Hoshino put on his thick-soled Nike sneakers and walked out of the apartment,
leaving the door unlocked. In one hand he held his bag with all his things, in the other
the bag with that white thing's corpse.
"Gentlemen," he said, gazing up at the dawn rising in the east, "it's time to light
my fire!"
Chapter 49
Just after nine the next morning, I hear the sound of a car approaching and go outside.
It's a small four-wheel-drive Datsun truck, the kind with massive tires and the body
jacked up high. It looks like it hasn't been washed in at least a half a year. In the bed are
two long, well-used surfboards. The truck grinds to a stop in front of the cabin. When
the engine cuts off silence returns. The door opens and a tall young man climbs out,
wearing an oversize white T-shirt, an oil-stained No Fear shirt, khaki shorts, and
sneakers that have seen better days. The guy looks around thirty, with wide shoulders.
He's tanned all over and has three days' worth of stubble on his face. His hair's long
enough to hide his ears. I'm guessing this must be Oshima's older brother, the one who
runs a surf shop in Kochi.
"Hey," he says.
"Morning," I reply.
He sticks out his hand, and we shake hands on the porch. He has a strong grip. I
guessed right. He does turn out to be Oshima's older brother.
"Everybody calls me Sada," he tells me. He talks slowly, choosing his words
deliberately, like he's in no hurry. Like he has all the time in the world. "I got a call from
Takamatsu to come pick you up and take you back," he explains. "Sounds like some
urgent business came up."
"Urgent business?"
"Yeah. I don't know what, though."
"Sorry you had to go to all this trouble," I tell him.
"No need to apologize," he says. "Can you get ready to leave soon?"
"Give me five minutes."
While I'm stuffing my things in my backpack, he helps me close up the place,
whistling all the while. He shuts the window, pulls the curtains, checks that the gas is off,
gathers up the remaining food, does a quick scrub of the sink. I can tell from watching
him that he feels like the cabin's an extension of himself.
"Seems like my brother likes you," Sada says. "He doesn't like all that many
people. He's sort of a difficult person."
"He's been really kind to me."
Sada nods. "He can be pretty nice when he wants to be."
I climb into the passenger seat of the truck and toss my backpack at my feet.
Sada turns on the ignition, shifts into gear, leans out the window to check out the
cabin one more time, then steps on the gas. "This cabin is one of the few things the two
of us share as brothers," he says as he expertly maneuvers down the mountain road.
"When the mood hits us, we sometimes come here and spend a few days alone." He
mulls this over for a while, then goes on. "This was always an important place for the
two of us, and still is. It's like there's a power here that recharges us. A quiet sort of
power. You know what I mean?"
"I think so," I tell him.
"My brother said you would," Sada says. "People that don't get it never will."
The faded cloth seats are covered with white dog hair. The dog smell mixes with
that of the sea, plus the scent of surfboard wax and cigarettes. The knob for the AC is
broken off. The ashtray's full of butts, the side pocket stuffed full of random cassette
tapes, minus their boxes.
"I went into the woods a few times," I say.
"Deep in there?"
"Yes," I reply. "Oshima warned me not to."
"But you went in anyway."
"Yeah," I say.
"I did the same once. Must be like ten years ago." He's silent for a time,
concentrating on his driving. We're on a long curve, the thick tires spraying pebbles as
we go. Every so often there're crows beside the road. They don't try to fly away, just
watch intently, with curious eyes, as we pass by.
"Did you run across the soldiers?" Sada asks as casually as if he'd asked me what
time it was.
"You mean those two soldiers?"
"Right," Sada responds, glancing at me. "You went in that far, huh?"
"Yeah, I did," I reply.
His hands lightly gripping the wheel as he maneuvers it, he doesn't respond, and
his expression doesn't tell me anything.
"Sada?" I ask.
"Hm?" he says.
"When you met those soldiers ten years ago, what did you do?"
"What did I do when I met those soldiers?" he repeats.
I nod and wait for his answer.
He glances in the rearview mirror, then looks in front again. "I've never talked
about that to anyone," he says. "Not even to my brother. Brother, sister--whatever you
want to call him. Brother works for me. He doesn't know anything about those soldiers."
I nod silently.
"And I doubt I'll ever tell anybody about it. Even you. And I don't think you'll
ever talk about it to anyone, either. Even to me. You know what I'm trying to say?"
"I think so," I tell him.
"What is it?"
"It's not something you can get across in words. The real response is something
words can't express."
"There you go," Sada replies. "Exactly. If you can't get it across in words then it's
better not to try."
"Even to yourself?" I ask.
"Yeah, even to yourself," Sada says. "Better not to try to explain it, even to
yourself."
He offers me a stick of Cool Mint gum. I take one and start chewing.
"You ever try surfing?" he asks.
"No."
"If you have the chance I'll teach you," he says. "If you'd like to learn, I mean.
The waves are pretty decent along the Kochi shore, and there aren't so many surfers.
Surfing's a more profound kind of sport than it looks. When you surf you learn not to
fight the power of nature, even if it gets violent."
He takes out a cigarette from the pocket of his T-shirt, sticks it in his mouth, and
lights it up with the dashboard lighter. "That's another thing that words can't explain.
One of those things that's neither a yes or a no answer." He narrows his eyes and blows
smoke out the window. "In Hawaii," he goes on, "there's a spot they call the Toilet Bowl.
There're these huge whirlpools because it's where the incoming and outgoing tides meet
and crash into each other. It goes around and around like when you flush a toilet. If you
wipe out there, you get pulled underwater and it's hard to float up again. Depending on
the waves you might never make it back to the surface. So there you are, underwater,
pounded by waves, and there's nothing you can do. Flailing around's not gonna get you
anywhere. You'll just use up your energy. You've never been so scared in your life. But
unless you get over that fear you'll never be a real surfer. You have to face death, get to
really know it, then overcome it. When you're down in that whirlpool you start thinking
about all kinds of things. It's like you get to be friends with death, have a heart-to-heart
talk with it."
At the gate he gets out of the truck and locks it back up, jiggling the chain a
couple of times to make sure it'll hold.
After this we don't talk much. He leaves an FM station on as he drives, but I can
tell he's not really listening to it. Having the radio on's just a token gesture. Even when
we go into a tunnel and all we hear is static, he doesn't mind. With the AC broken, we
leave the windows open when we get on the highway.
"If you ever feel like learning how to surf, stop by and see me," Sada says as the
Inland Sea comes into view. "I have an extra room, and you can stay as long as you
like."
"Thanks," I say. "I'll take you up on that. I don't know when, though."
"You pretty busy?"
"I have a couple of things I have to take care of."
"Same with me," Sada says.
We don't say anything for a long time. He's thinking over his problems, I'm
thinking over mine. He keeps his eyes on the road, left hand on top of the steering wheel,
and smokes an occasional cigarette. Unlike Oshima, he doesn't speed. With his elbow
propped on the open window, he drives down the highway at a leisurely pace. The only
time he passes other cars is when they're going way too slow. Then he reluctantly steps
on the gas, goes around, then slips right back into his lane.
"Have you been surfing for a long time?" I ask him.
"Hmm," he says, and then there's silence. Finally, when I've almost forgotten the
question, he answers.
"I've been surfing since high school. Then it was just for fun. Didn't really get
serious about it till six years ago. I was working at a big ad agency in Tokyo. I couldn't
stand it so I quit, moved back here, and started surfing. I took out a loan, borrowed some
money from my folks, and opened a surf shop. I run it alone, so I can pretty much do
whatever I want."
"Did you want to come back to Shikoku?"
"That was part of it," he says. "I don't know, I don't feel right unless I've got the
sea and mountains nearby. People are mostly a product of where they were born and
raised. How you think and feel's always linked to the lay of the land, the temperature.
The prevailing winds, even. Where were you born?"
"Tokyo. In Nogata, in Nakano Ward."
"Do you want to go back there?"
I shake my head. "No."
"Why not?"
"There's no reason for me to go back."
"Okay," he says.
"I'm not very connected to the lay of the land, the prevailing winds and all that," I
say.
"Yeah?" he says.
We're silent again. Silence doesn't seem to bother him a bit. Or me either. I just sit
there, my mind a blank, listening to the music on the radio. He's staring at the road
straight ahead. Eventually we exit the highway, turn north, and come into the Takamatsu
city limits.
It's a little before one p. m. when we arrive at the Komura Library. Sada drops me
off in front but doesn't get out himself. The engine's still on, and he's heading right back
to Kochi.
"Thanks," I say.
"Hope we can see each other soon," he says. He sticks his hand out the window,
gives a short wave, then peels out on his thick tires. Heading back to catch some big
waves, to his own world, his own issues.
I put on my backpack and pass through the gate. I catch a whiff of the freshly
mown lawn in the garden. It feels like I've been away for months, but it's only been four
days.
Oshima's at the counter, wearing a tie, something I've never seen before. A white
button-down shirt, and a mustard-yellow-and-green-striped tie. He's rolled the sleeves
up to his elbows and doesn't have a jacket on. In front of him, predictably, there's a
coffee cup and two neatly sharpened pencils.
"Hey," he greets me, adding his usual smile.
"Hi," I say back.
"Guess you caught a ride with my brother?"
"That's right."
"Bet he didn't talk much," Oshima says.
"Actually, we did talk a little."
"You're lucky. Depending on who he's with, sometimes he won't say a word."
"Did something happen here?" I ask. "He told me there was something urgent."
Oshima nods. "There are a couple of things you need to know about. First of all,
Miss Saeki passed away. She had a heart attack. I found her collapsed facedown on her
desk upstairs on Tuesday afternoon. It happened all of a sudden, and it doesn't seem like
she suffered."
I set my pack on the floor and sit down in a chair. "Tuesday afternoon?" I ask.
"Today's Friday, right?"
"Yes, that's right. She died after the regular Tuesday tour. I probably should've
gotten in touch with you sooner, but I couldn't think straight."
Sunk back in the chair, I find I can't move. The two of us sit there in silence for a
long time. I can see the stairs leading to the second floor, the well-polished black
banister, the stained glass on the landing. Those stairs always held a special significance
for me, because they led to her, to Miss Saeki. But now they're just empty stairs, with no
meaning at all. She's no longer there.
"As I mentioned before, I think this was all predestined," Oshima says. "I knew it,
and so did she. Though when it actually happens, of course, it's pretty hard to take."
When he pauses, I feel like I should say something, but the words won't come.
"According to her wishes, there won't be a funeral," Oshima continues. "She was
quietly cremated. She left a will in a drawer in her desk upstairs. She left her entire
estate to the foundation that runs the library. She left me her Mont Blanc pen as a
keepsake. And a painting for you. The one of the boy on the shore. You'll take it, won't
you?"
I nod.
"It's all wrapped up over there, ready to go."
"Thanks," I say, finally able to speak.
"Tell me something, Kafka Tamura," Oshima says. He picks up a pencil and
gives it his usual twirl. "Is it okay if I ask you a question?"
I nod.
"I didn't need to tell you she died, did I? You already knew."
Again I nod. "I think I did."
"I thought so," Oshima says, and draws a deep breath. "Would you like some
water or something? To tell you the truth, you look as parched as a desert."
"Thanks, I could use some." I am pretty thirsty, but hadn't realized it until he
mentioned it.
I down the ice water he brings me in a single gulp, so fast my head starts to ache.
I put the empty glass back on the table.
"Care for some more?"
I shake my head.
"What are your plans now?" Oshima asks.
"I'm going to go back to Tokyo," I reply.
"What are you going to do there?"
"Go to the police, first of all, and tell them what I know. If I don't, they'll be after
me the rest of my life. And then I'll most likely go back to school. Not that I want to, but
I have to at least finish junior high. If I just put up with it for a few months and graduate,
then I can do whatever I want."
"Makes sense," Oshima says. He narrows his eyes and looks at me. "That sounds
like the best plan."
"More and more I've been thinking that's the way to go."
"You can run but you can't hide?"
"Yeah, I guess so," I say.
"You've grown up."
I shake my head. I can't say a thing.
Oshima lightly taps the eraser end of a pencil against his temple a couple of times.
The phone rings, but he ignores it.
"Every one of us is losing something precious to us," he says after the phone
stops ringing. "Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back
again. That's part of what it means to be alive. But inside our heads--at least that's where
I imagine it--there's a little room where we store those memories. A room like the stacks
in this library. And to understand the workings of our own heart we have to keep on
making new reference cards. We have to dust things off every once in a while, let in
fresh air, change the water in the flower vases. In other words, you'll live forever in your
own private library."
I stare at the pencil in his hand. It pains me to look at it, but I have to be the
world's toughest fifteen-year-old, at least for a while longer. Or pretend to be. I take a
deep breath, fill my lungs with air, and manage to inhale that lump of emotion. "Is it all
right if I come back here someday?" I ask.
"Of course," Oshima says, and lays his pencil back on the counter. He links his
hands behind his head and looks straight at me. "The word is that I'll be in charge of the
library for a while. And I imagine I'll need an assistant. Once you're free of the police,
school, what have you--and provided you want to, of course--I'd love to have you back.
The town and I aren't going anywhere, not for the time being. People need a place they
can belong."
"Thanks," I tell him.
"You're quite welcome," he says.
"Your brother said he'd teach me how to surf."
"That's great. He doesn't take to most people," he says. "He's a bit of a difficult
person."
I nod, and smile. They really are quite alike, these two brothers.
"Kafka," Oshima says, looking deep into my eyes. "I could be wrong, but I think
that's the first time I've ever seen you smile."
"You could be right," I say. I most definitely am smiling. And blushing.
"When are you going back to Tokyo?"
"Right now, I think."
"Can't you wait till evening? I can drive you to the station after we close up."
I consider this, then shake my head. "Thanks. But I think it's best if I leave right
away."
Oshima nods. He goes into a back room and brings out the neatly wrapped
painting. He also puts a single copy of the record "Kafka on the Shore" in a bag and
hands it to me. "A little present from me."
"Thanks," I say. "Is it okay if I go up and see Miss Saeki's room one more time?"
"Go right ahead."
"Would you come with me?"
"Of course."
We go upstairs to her room. I stand in front of her desk, lightly touch its surface,
and think over all the things it has absorbed. I picture her slumped facedown on the desk.
How she always sat there, the window behind her, busily writing away. How I brought
her coffee, when she'd glance up as I opened the door and came inside. How she always
smiled at me.
"What was it she was writing here?" I ask.
"I don't know," Oshima replies. "One thing I do know for sure is she took a lot of
secrets with her when she left this world."
A lot of theories as well, I silently think.
The window's open, the June breeze gently rustling the hem of the white lace
curtains. A faint scent of the sea is in the air. I remember feeling the sand in my hand at
the beach. I walk away from the desk and over to Oshima, and hold him tight. His slim
body calls up all sorts of nostalgic memories.
He gently rubs my hair. "The world is a metaphor, Kafka Tamura," he says into
my ear. "But for you and me this library alone is no metaphor. It's always just this
library. I want to make sure we understand that."
"Of course," I say.
"It's a unique, special library. And nothing else can ever take its place."
I nod.
"Good-bye, Kafka," Oshima says.
"Good-bye, Oshima," I say. "You know, you look good in that necktie."
He lets go of me, looks me in the face, and smiles. "I've been waiting for you to
say that."
Shouldering my backpack, I walk to the local station and take the train back to
Takamatsu Station. I buy a ticket to Tokyo at the counter. The train will get in to Tokyo
late at night, so the first thing I'll have to do is find a place to stay for the night, then
head over to my house in Nogata the next day. I'll be all alone in that huge, vacant house.
Nobody's waiting for me to come home. But I have no other place to go back to.
I use a public phone at the station and call Sakura's cell phone. She's in the middle
of work but says she can spare a couple minutes. That's fine, I tell her.
"I'm going back to Tokyo now," I tell her. "I'm at Takamatsu Station. I just
wanted to tell you."
"You're finished running away from home?"
"I guess so."
"Fifteen's a little early to run away, anyway," she says. "But what are you going
to do back in Tokyo?"
"Go back to school."
"That's probably a good idea," she says.
"You're going back to Tokyo too, aren't you?"
"Yeah, probably in September. I might go on a trip somewhere in the summer."
"Can I see you in Tokyo?"
"Yeah, of course," she says. "Can you tell me your number?"
I give her the number at my house, and she writes it down.
"I had a dream about you the other day," she says.
"I had one about you too."
"A pretty raunchy one, I bet?"
"Could be," I admit. "But it was just a dream. What about yours?"
"Mine wasn't raunchy. You were in this huge house that was like a maze, walking
around, searching for some special room, but you couldn't find it. There was somebody
else in the house, looking for you. I tried to yell a warning, but you couldn't hear me. A
pretty scary dream. When I woke up I was exhausted from all that yelling. I've been
worried about you ever since."
"I appreciate it," I say. "But that's just a dream too."
"Nothing bad happened to you?"
"No, nothing bad." No, nothing bad, I tell myself.
"Good-bye, Kafka," she says. "I have to get back to work, but if you ever want to
talk, just call me, okay?"
"Good-bye," I say. "Sister," I add.
Over the bridge and across the water we go, and I transfer to the bullet train at
Okayama Station. I sink back in my seat and close my eyes. My body gradually adjusts
to the train's vibration. The tightly wrapped painting of Kafka on the Shore is at my feet.
I can feel it there.
"I want you to remember me," Miss Saeki says, and looks right into my eyes.
"If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets."
Time weighs down on you like an old, ambiguous dream. You keep on moving,
trying to slip through it. But even if you go to the ends of the earth, you won't be able to
escape it. Still, you have to go there--to the edge of the world. There's something you
can't do unless you get there.
It starts to rain just after we pass Nagoya. I stare at the drops streaking the dark
window. It was raining the day I left Tokyo, too. I picture rain falling in all sorts of
places--in a forest, on the sea, a highway, a library. Rain falling at the edge of the world.
I close my eyes and relax, letting my tense muscles go loose. I listen to the steady
hum of the train. And then, without warning, a warm tear spills from my eye, runs down
my cheek to my mouth, and, after a while, dries up. No matter, I tell myself. It's just one
tear. It doesn't even feel like it's mine, more like part of the rain outside.
Did I do the right thing?
"You did the right thing," the boy named Crow says. "You did what was best. No
one else could have done as well as you did. After all, you're the genuine article: the
toughest fifteen-year-old in the world."
"But I still don't know anything about life," I protest.
"Look at the painting," he says. "And listen to the wind."
I nod.
"I know you can do it."
I nod again.
"You'd better get some sleep," the boy named Crow says. "When you wake up,
you'll be part of a brand-new world."
You finally fall asleep. And when you wake up, it's true.
You are part of a brand-new world.
